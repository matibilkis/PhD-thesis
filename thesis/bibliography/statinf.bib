 abstract = {Let S0 be any sequential probability ratio test for deciding between two simple alternatives H0 and H1, and S1 another test for the same purpose. We define (i, j = 0, 1): Î±i(Sj) = probability, under Sj, of rejecting Hi when it is true; Ei j (n) = expected number of observations to reach a decision under test Sj when the hypothesis Hi is true. (It is assumed that E1 i (n) exists.) In this paper it is proved that, if $\alpha_i(S_1) \leq \alpha_i(S_0)\quad(i = 0,1)$, it follows that $E_i^0 (n) \leq E_i^1 (n)\quad(i = 0, 1)$. This means that of all tests with the same power the sequential probability ratio test requires on the average fewest observations. This result had been conjectured earlier ([1], [2]).},
