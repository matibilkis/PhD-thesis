@misc{Rosati2017b,
abstract = {We study the problem of decoding classical information encoded on quantum states at the output of a quantum channel, with particular focus on increasing the communication rates towards the maximum allowed by Quantum Mechanics. After a brief introduction to the main theoretical formalism employed in the rest of the thesis, i.e., continuous-variable Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Communication Theory, we consider several decoding schemes. First, we treat the problem from an abstract perspective, presenting a method to decompose any quantum measurement into a sequence of easier nested measurements through a binary-tree search. Furthermore we show that this decomposition can be used to build a capacity-achieving decoding protocol for classical communication on quantum channels and to solve the optimal discrimination of some sets of quantum states. These results clarify the structure of optimal quantum measurements, showing that it can be recast in a more operational and experimentally-oriented fashion. Second, we consider a more practical approach and describe three receiver structures for coherent states of the electromagnetic field with applications to single-mode state discrimination and multi-mode decoding at the output of a quantum channel. We treat the problem bearing in mind the technological limitations faced nowadays in the field of optical communications: we evaluate the performance of general decoding schemes based on such technology and report increased performance of two schemes, the first one employing a non-Gaussian transformation and the second one employing a code tailored to be read out easily by the most common detectors. Eventually we characterize a large class of multi-mode adaptive receivers based on common technological resources, obtaining a no-go theorem for their capacity.},

The discrimination is performed via an optimized, feedback-mediated displacement prior to a photon counting detector.

@article{Bilkis2020a,
abstract = {The optimal discrimination of coherent states of light with current technology is a key problem in classical and quantum communication, whose solution would enable the realization of efficient receivers for long-distance communications in free-space and optical fiber channels. In this article, we show that reinforcement learning (RL) protocols allow an agent to learn near-optimal coherent-state receivers made of passive linear optics, photodetectors and classical adaptive control. Each agent is trained and tested in real time over several runs of independent discrimination experiments and has no knowledge about the energy of the states nor the receiver setup nor the quantum-mechanical laws governing the experiments. Based exclusively on the observed photodetector outcomes, the agent adaptively chooses among a set of ∼ 3{\textperiodcentered}103 possible receiver setups, and obtains a reward at the end of each experiment if its guess is correct. At variance with previous applications of RL in quantum physics, the information gathered in each run is intrinsically stochastic and thus insufficient to evaluate exactly the performance of the chosen receiver. Nevertheless, we present families of agents that: (i) discover a receiver beating the best Gaussian receiver after ∼ 3{\textperiodcentered}102 experiments; (ii) surpass the cumulative reward of the best Gaussian receiver after ∼ 103 experiments; (iii) simultaneously discover a near-optimal receiver and attain its cumulative reward after ∼ 105 experiments. Our results show that RL techniques are suitable for on-line control of quantum receivers and can be employed for long-distance communications over potentially unknown channels.},

@article{Cook2007,
abstract = {Quantum mechanics hinders our ability to determine the state of a physical system in two ways: individual measurements provide only partial information about the observed system ( because of Heisenberg uncertainty), and measurements are themselves invasive - meaning that little or no refinement is achieved by further observation of an already measured system(1). Theoretical methods have been developed to maximize the information gained from a quantum measurement while also minimizing disturbance(2-4), but laboratory implementation of optimal measurement procedures is often difficult. The standard class of operations considered in quantum information theory(5) tends to rely on superposition-basis and entangled measurements(6), which require high-fidelity implementation to be effective in the laboratory(7). Here we demonstrate that real-time quantum feedback(8-10) can be used in place of a delicate quantum superposition, often called a 'Schrodinger cat state', to implement an optimal quantum measurement for discriminating between optical coherent states(11,12). Our procedure actively manipulates the target system during the measurement process, and uses quantum feedback to modify the statistics of an otherwise sub-optimal operator to emulate the optimal cat-state measurement. We verify a long-standing theoretical prediction(13) and demonstrate feedback-mediated quantum measurement(10,14) at its fundamental quantum limit over a non-trivial region of parameter space.},

@article{Pirandola2019a,
abstract = {What is the ultimate performance for discriminating two arbitrary quantum channels acting on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space? Here we address this basic question by deriving a general and fundamental lower bound. More precisely, we investigate the symmetric discrimination of two arbitrary qudit channels by means of the most general protocols based on adaptive (feedback-assisted) quantum operations. In this general scenario, we first show how port-based teleportation can be used to simplify these adaptive protocols into a much simpler non-adaptive form, designing a new type of teleportation stretching. Then, we prove that the minimum error probability affecting the channel discrimination cannot beat a bound determined by the Choi matrices of the channels, establishing a general, yet computable formula for quantum hypothesis testing. As a consequence of this bound, we derive ultimate limits and no-go theorems for adaptive quantum illumination and single-photon quantum optical resolution. Finally, we show how the methodology can also be applied to other tasks, such as quantum metrology, quantum communication and secret key generation.},

@article{Bilkis2020,
abstract = {The optimal discrimination of coherent states of light with current technology is a key problem in classical and quantum communication, whose solution would enable the realization of efficient receivers for long-distance communications in free-space and optical fiber channels. In this article, we show that reinforcement learning (RL) protocols allow an agent to learn near-optimal coherent-state receivers made of passive linear optics, photodetectors and classical adaptive control. Each agent is trained and tested in real time over several runs of independent discrimination experiments and has no knowledge about the energy of the states nor the receiver setup nor the quantum-mechanical laws governing the experiments. Based exclusively on the observed photodetector outcomes, the agent adaptively chooses among a set of {\~{}}3 10{\^{}}3 possible receiver setups, and obtains a reward at the end of each experiment if its guess is correct. At variance with previous applications of RL in quantum physics, the information gathered in each run is intrinsically stochastic and thus insufficient to evaluate exactly the performance of the chosen receiver. Nevertheless, we present families of agents that: (i) discover a receiver beating the best Gaussian receiver after {\~{}}3 10{\^{}}2 experiments; (ii) surpass the cumulative reward of the best Gaussian receiver after {\~{}}10{\^{}}3 experiments; (iii) simultaneously discover a near-optimal receiver and attain its cumulative reward after {\~{}}10{\^{}}5 experiments. Our results show that RL techniques are suitable for on-line control of quantum receivers and can be employed for long-distance communications over potentially unknown channels.},

@article{Pirandola2019,
abstract = {Quantum cryptography is arguably the fastest growing area in quantum information science. Novel theoretical protocols are designed on a regular basis, security proofs are constantly improving, and experiments are gradually moving from proof-of-principle lab demonstrations to in-field implementations and technological prototypes. In this review, we provide both a general introduction and a state of the art description of the recent advances in the field, both theoretically and experimentally. We start by reviewing protocols of quantum key distribution based on discrete variable systems. Next we consider aspects of device independence, satellite challenges, and high rate protocols based on continuous variable systems. We will then discuss the ultimate limits of point-to-point private communications and how quantum repeaters and networks may overcome these restrictions. Finally, we will discuss some aspects of quantum cryptography beyond standard quantum key distribution, including quantum data locking and quantum digital signatures.},
