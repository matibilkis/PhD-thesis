abstract = {We consider the sequential quantum channel discrimination problem using adaptive and non-adaptive strategies. In this setting the number of uses of the underlying quantum channel is not fixed but a random variable that is either bounded in expectation or with high probability. We show that, by using adaptive strategies for the discrimination problem, both types of error probabilities decrease to zero exponentially fast and the rates are characterized by the measured relative entropy between two quantum channels. Allowing for quantum memory, we see that the optimal rates are given by the regularized channel relative entropy. We also characterize the error exponents in the discrimination problem if non-adaptive strategies are used.},

title = {ViterbiNet: A Deep Learning Based Viterbi Algorithm for Symbol Detection},
abstract = {<p>Symbol detection plays an important role in the implementation of digital receivers. In this work, we propose ViterbiNet, which is a data-driven symbol detector that does not require channel state information (CSI). ViterbiNet is obtained by integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the Viterbi algorithm. We identify the specific parts of the Viterbi algorithm that depend on the channel model, and design a DNN to implement only those computations, leaving the rest of the algorithm structure intact. We then propose a meta-learning based approach to train ViterbiNet online based on recent decisions, allowing the receiver to track dynamic channel conditions without requiring new training samples for every coherence block. Our numerical evaluations demonstrate that the performance of ViterbiNet, which is ignorant of the CSI, approaches that of the CSI-based Viterbi algorithm, and is capable of tracking time-varying channels without needing instantaneous CSI or additional training data. Moreover, unlike conventional Viterbi detection, ViterbiNet is robust to CSI uncertainty, and it can be reliably implemented in complex channel models with constrained computational burden. More broadly, our results demonstrate the conceptual benefit of designing communication systems that integrate DNNs into established algorithms.</p>},

abstract={Nanostructures in which strong (Coulomb) interactions exist between electrons are predicted to exhibit temporal electronic correlations1. Although there is ample experimental evidence that such correlations exist2, electron dynamics in engineered nanostructures have been observed directly only on long timescales3. The faster dynamics associated with electrical currents or charge fluctuations4 are usually inferred from direct (or quasi-direct) current measurements. Recently, interest in electron dynamics has risen, in part owing to the realization that additional information about electronic interactions can be found in the shot noise5 or higher statistical moments6,7 of a direct current. Furthermore, interest in quantum computation has stimulated investigation of quantum bit (qubit) readout techniques8,9, which for many condensed-matter systems ultimately reduces to single-shot measurements of individual electronic charges. Here we report real-time observation of individual electron tunnelling events in a quantum dot using an integrated radio-frequency single-electron transistor10,11. We use electron counting to measure directly the quantum dot's tunnelling rate and the occupational probabilities of its charge state. Our results provide evidence in favour of long (10{\thinspace}{\textmu}s or more) inelastic scattering times in nearly isolated dots.},

abstract={There is an intimate connection between the acquisition of information and how this information changes the remaining uncertainty in the system. This trade-off between information and uncertainty plays a central role in the context of detection. Recent advances in the ability to make accurate, on-chip measurements of individual-electron current through a quantum dot1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 (QD) have been enabled by exploiting the sensitivity of a second current, passing through a nearby quantum point contact (QPC), to the fluctuating charge on the QD4,5,6,7,8. An important characteristic of QPC detectors is their minimal influence on the systems they probe. Here we show that even the operation of an effectively non-invasive QPC detector can statistically alter the system's behaviour. By observing a particular QPC current, the statistical distribution of the QD conditional current undergoes a substantial change in comparison to that expected for unconditional shot noise9. These results are in almost perfect agreement with a theoretical model we develop to predict the joint current probability distribution and conditional transport statistics of interacting nanoscale systems.},

By introducing a rotating wave approximation for the measurement and bath coupling, we can provide a more intuitive analysis of the achievable cooling in various regimes of measurement sensitivity and temperature. We also discuss explicitly the effect of backaction noise on the characteristics of the optimal feedback. The resulting rotating wave master equation has found application in our recent work on squeezing the oscillator motion using parametric driving and may have wider interest. },

	abstract = { A new class of stochastic Runge--Kutta methods for the weak approximation of the solution of It{\^o} stochastic differential equation systems with a multidimensional Wiener process is introduced. As the main innovation, the number of stages of the methods does not depend on the dimension of the driving Wiener process, and the number of necessary random variables which have to be simulated is reduced considerably. Compared to well-known schemes, this reduces the computational effort significantly. Order conditions for the stochastic Runge--Kutta methods assuring weak convergence with order two are calculated by applying the colored rooted tree analysis due to the author. Further, some coefficients for explicit second order stochastic Runge--Kutta schemes are presented. },

	abstract = {Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},
