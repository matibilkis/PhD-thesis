abstract={Applications such as simulating complicated quantum systems or solving large-scale linear algebra problems are very challenging for classical computers, owing to the extremely high computational cost. Quantum computers promise a solution, although fault-tolerant quantum computers will probably not be available in the near future. Current quantum devices have serious constraints, including limited numbers of qubits and noise processes that limit circuit depth. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which use a classical optimizer to train a parameterized quantum circuit, have emerged as a leading strategy to address these constraints. VQAs have now been proposed for essentially all applications that researchers have envisaged for quantum computers, and they appear to be the best hope for obtaining quantum advantage. Nevertheless, challenges remain, including the trainability, accuracy and efficiency of VQAs. Here we overview the field of VQAs, discuss strategies to overcome their challenges and highlight the exciting prospects for using them to obtain quantum advantage.},

Studies on the Thomson model show that the GSA is more efficient than the classical simulated annealing and the fast simulated annealing. The fluctuation of energy is reduced drastically. The convergence to the global minimum is fast. We believe the GSA algorithm is a powerful method to find the global minimum in more realistic problems, like the equilibrium structure of big clusters.}

pages={583-589},
abstract={Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1--4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence---the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem'8---has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10--14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

abstract = {Recently proposed quantum-chaotic sensors achieve quantum enhancements in measurement precision by applying nonlinear control pulses to the dynamics of the quantum sensor while using classical initial states that are easy to prepare. Here, we use the cross-entropy method of reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the strength and position of control pulses. Compared to the quantum-chaotic sensors with periodic control pulses in the presence of superradiant damping, we find that decoherence can be fought even better and measurement precision can be enhanced further by optimizing the control. In some examples, we find enhancements in sensitivity by more than an order of magnitude. By visualizing the evolution of the quantum state, the mechanism exploited by the RL method is identified as a kind of spin-squeezing strategy that is adapted to the superradiant damping.}

Here we provide a rigorous treatment of the effects of beam wandering, one of the leading disturbances in atmospheric channels, on the quantum properties of light. From first principles we derive the probability distribution of the beam transmissivity, with the aim to completely characterize the quantum state of light. It turns out that beam wandering may preserve nonclassical effects, such as entanglement, quadrature and photon number squeezing, much better than a standard attenuating channel of the same losses.},

abstract = {We study the problem of decoding classical information encoded on quantum states at the output of a quantum channel, with particular focus on increasing the communication rates towards the maximum allowed by Quantum Mechanics. After a brief introduction to the main theoretical formalism employed in the rest of the thesis, i.e., continuous-variable Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Communication Theory, we consider several decoding schemes. First, we treat the problem from an abstract perspective, presenting a method to decompose any quantum measurement into a sequence of easier nested measurements through a binary-tree search. Furthermore we show that this decomposition can be used to build a capacity-achieving decoding protocol for classical communication on quantum channels and to solve the optimal discrimination of some sets of quantum states. These results clarify the structure of optimal quantum measurements, showing that it can be recast in a more operational and experimentally-oriented fashion. Second, we consider a more practical approach and describe three receiver structures for coherent states of the electromagnetic field with applications to single-mode state discrimination and multi-mode decoding at the output of a quantum channel. We treat the problem bearing in mind the technological limitations faced nowadays in the field of optical communications: we evaluate the performance of general decoding schemes based on such technology and report increased performance of two schemes, the first one employing a non-Gaussian transformation and the second one employing a code tailored to be read out easily by the most common detectors. Eventually we characterize a large class of multi-mode adaptive receivers based on common technological resources, obtaining a no-go theorem for their capacity.},

abstract = {Quantum mechanics hinders our ability to determine the state of a physical system in two ways: individual measurements provide only partial information about the observed system ( because of Heisenberg uncertainty), and measurements are themselves invasive - meaning that little or no refinement is achieved by further observation of an already measured system(1). Theoretical methods have been developed to maximize the information gained from a quantum measurement while also minimizing disturbance(2-4), but laboratory implementation of optimal measurement procedures is often difficult. The standard class of operations considered in quantum information theory(5) tends to rely on superposition-basis and entangled measurements(6), which require high-fidelity implementation to be effective in the laboratory(7). Here we demonstrate that real-time quantum feedback(8-10) can be used in place of a delicate quantum superposition, often called a 'Schrodinger cat state', to implement an optimal quantum measurement for discriminating between optical coherent states(11,12). Our procedure actively manipulates the target system during the measurement process, and uses quantum feedback to modify the statistics of an otherwise sub-optimal operator to emulate the optimal cat-state measurement. We verify a long-standing theoretical prediction(13) and demonstrate feedback-mediated quantum measurement(10,14) at its fundamental quantum limit over a non-trivial region of parameter space.},

abstract = {What is the ultimate performance for discriminating two arbitrary quantum channels acting on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space? Here we address this basic question by deriving a general and fundamental lower bound. More precisely, we investigate the symmetric discrimination of two arbitrary qudit channels by means of the most general protocols based on adaptive (feedback-assisted) quantum operations. In this general scenario, we first show how port-based teleportation can be used to simplify these adaptive protocols into a much simpler non-adaptive form, designing a new type of teleportation stretching. Then, we prove that the minimum error probability affecting the channel discrimination cannot beat a bound determined by the Choi matrices of the channels, establishing a general, yet computable formula for quantum hypothesis testing. As a consequence of this bound, we derive ultimate limits and no-go theorems for adaptive quantum illumination and single-photon quantum optical resolution. Finally, we show how the methodology can also be applied to other tasks, such as quantum metrology, quantum communication and secret key generation.},

abstract = {Quantum cryptography is arguably the fastest growing area in quantum information science. Novel theoretical protocols are designed on a regular basis, security proofs are constantly improving, and experiments are gradually moving from proof-of-principle lab demonstrations to in-field implementations and technological prototypes. In this review, we provide both a general introduction and a state of the art description of the recent advances in the field, both theoretically and experimentally. We start by reviewing protocols of quantum key distribution based on discrete variable systems. Next we consider aspects of device independence, satellite challenges, and high rate protocols based on continuous variable systems. We will then discuss the ultimate limits of point-to-point private communications and how quantum repeaters and networks may overcome these restrictions. Finally, we will discuss some aspects of quantum cryptography beyond standard quantum key distribution, including quantum data locking and quantum digital signatures.},

@article{simpleRegretMunoz,
abstract = {We consider the framework of stochastic multi-armed bandit problems and study the possibilities and limitations of forecasters that perform an on-line exploration of the arms. These forecasters are assessed in terms of their simple regret, a regret notion that captures the fact that exploration is only constrained by the number of available rounds (not necessarily known in advance), in contrast to the case when the cumulative regret is considered and when exploitation needs to be performed at the same time. We believe that this performance criterion is suited to situations when the cost of pulling an arm is expressed in terms of resources rather than rewards. We discuss the links between the simple and the cumulative regret. One of the main results in the case of a finite number of arms is a general lower bound on the simple regret of a forecaster in terms of its cumulative regret: the smaller the latter, the larger the former. Keeping this result in mind, we then exhibit upper bounds on the simple regret of some forecasters. The paper ends with a study devoted to continuous-armed bandit problems; we show that the simple regret can be minimized with respect to a family of probability distributions if and only if the cumulative regret can be minimized for it. Based on this equivalence, we are able to prove that the separable metric spaces are exactly the metric spaces on which these regrets can be minimized with respect to the family of all probability distributions with continuous mean-payoff functions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {After nearly two years since starting to write the blog we have at last completed a first draft of the book, which is to be published by Cambridge University Press. The book is available for free as a PDF and will remain so after publication. We're grateful to Cambridge for allowing this. Without further ado, here is the link. Although we still have a few things we want to do, the manuscript is sufficiently polished to be useful. Of course we would greatly appreciate any comments you might have, including typos, errors in the proofs, missing references, confusing explanations or anything else you might notice. We will periodically update the book, so it would be helpful if you could quote the revision number on the cover when sending us your comments (banditalgs@gmail.com). The manuscript includes a lot of material not in the blog. The last seven chapters are all new, covering combinatorial (semi-)bandits, non-stationary bandits, ranking, pure exploration, Bayesian methods, Thompson sampling, partial monitoring and an introduction to learning in Markov decision processes. Those chapters that are based on blog posts have been cleaned up and often we have added significant depth. There is a lot of literature that we have not covered. Some of these missing topics are discussed in extreme brevity in the introduction to Part VII. It really is amazing how large the bandit literature has become and we're sorry not to have found space for everything. The book includes around 250 exercises, some of which have solutions. On average the exercises have been proofread less carefully than the rest of the book, so some caution is advised. The solutions to selected exercises are available here. Finally, we're very thankful for all the feedback already received, both on the blog and early drafts of the book.},

@article{Agrawal1995,
	Abstract = {We consider a non-Bayesian infinite horizon version of the multi-armed bandit problem with the objective of designing simple policies whose regret increases slowly with time. In their seminal work on this problem, Lai and Robbins had obtained a O (log n ) lower bound on the regret with a constant that depends on the Kullback--Leibler number. They also constructed policies for some specific families of probability distributions (including exponential families) that achieved the lower bound. In this paper we construct index policies that depend on the rewards from each arm only through their sample mean. These policies are computationally much simpler and are also applicable much more generally. They achieve a O (log n ) regret with a constant that is also based on the Kullback--Leibler number. This constant turns out to be optimal for one-parameter exponential families; however, in general it is derived from the optimal one via a `contraction' principle. Our results rely entirely on a few key lemmas from the theory of large deviations.},

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Unitary 2-designs are random unitaries simulating up to the second order statistical moments of the uniformly distributed random unitaries, often referred to as Haar random unitaries. They are used in a wide variety of theoretical and practical quantum information protocols and also have been used to model the dynamics in complex quantum many-body systems. Here, we show that unitary 2-designs can be approximately implemented by alternately repeating random unitaries diagonal in the Pauli-Z basis and Pauli-X basis. We also provide a converse about the number of repetitions needed to achieve unitary 2-designs. These results imply that the process after l repetitions achieves a Theta(d(-l))-approximate unitary 2-design. Based on the construction, we further provide quantum circuits that efficiently implement approximate unitary 2-designs. Although a more efficient implementation of unitary 2-designs is known, our quantum circuit has its own merit that it is divided into a constant number of commuting parts, which enables us to apply all commuting gates simultaneously and leads to a possible reduction of an actual execution time. We finally interpret the result in terms of the dynamics generated by time-dependent Hamiltonians and provide for the first time a random disordered time-dependent Hamiltonian that generates a unitary 2-design after switching interactions only a few times.

	Abstract = {In a two-player game, two cooperating but non communicating players, Alice and Bob, receive inputs taken from a probability distribution. Each of them produces an output and they win the game if they satisfy some predicate on their inputs/outputs. The entangled value $\omega$*(G) of a game G is the maximum probability that Alice and Bob can win the game if they are allowed to share an entangled state prior to receiving their inputs.
The n-fold parallel repetition Gn of G consists of n instances of G where Alice and Bob receive all the inputs at the same time and must produce all the outputs at the same time. They win Gn if they win each instance of G. Recently, there has been a series of works showing parallel repetition with exponential decay for projection games [DSV13], games on the uniform distribution [CS14] and for free games, i.e. games on a product distribution [JPY13].
This article is meant to be a follow up of [CS14], where we improve and simplify several parts of our previous paper. Our main result is that for any free game G with value $\omega$*(G)=1-$\epsilon$, we have $\omega$*(Gn){\textless}=(1-$\epsilon$2)$\Omega$(nlog(l)) where l is the size of the output set of the game. This result improves on both the results in [JPY13] and [CS14]. The framework we use can also be extended to free projection games. We show that for a free projection game G with value $\omega$*(G)=1-$\epsilon$, we have $\omega$*(Gn){\textless}=(1-$\epsilon$)$\Omega$(n).},

The optimality of the protocol is proven and extensions to other states and encodings are also studied.

	Abstract = {Recent research on the thermodynamic arrow of time, at the microscopic scale, has questioned the universality of its direction. Theoretical studies showed that quantum correlations can be used to revert the natural heat flow (from the hot body to the cold one), posing an apparent challenge to the second law of thermodynamics. Such an "anomalous" heat current was observed in a recent experiment (arXiv:1711.03323), by employing two spin systems initially quantum correlated. Nevertheless, the precise relationship between this intriguing phenomenon and the initial conditions that allow it is not fully evident. Here, we address energy transfer in an extended perspective, identifying a nonclassical contribution that applies to the reversion of the heat flow as well as to more general forms of energy exchange. We derive three theorems that describe the energy transfer between two microscopic systems, for arbitrary initial bipartite states. Such a process can be optimized through a certain type of quantum coherence, outperforming incoherent states. We also introduce a class of nonequilibrium states that only allow unidirectional energy flow, thus broadening the set where the standard Clausius statement of the second law applies. Finally, we show that for two qubits, coherence boosts the energy transfer along any direction (direct or reverse). In this case, coherence is the quantum resource underpinning the reversion of the thermodynamic arrow of time.},

	Abstract = {We develop a quantum learning scheme for binary discrimination of coherent states of light. This is a problem of technological relevance for the reading of information stored in a digital memory. In our setting, a coherent light source is used to illuminate a memory cell and retrieve its encoded bit by determining the quantum state of the reflected signal. We consider a situation where the amplitude of the states produced by the source is not fully known, but instead this information is encoded in a large training set comprising many copies of the same coherent state. We show that an optimal global measurement, performed jointly over the signal and the training set, provides higher successful identification rates than any learning strategy based on first estimating the unknown amplitude by means of Gaussian measurements on the training set, followed by an adaptive discrimination procedure on the signal. By considering a simplified variant of the problem, we argue that this is the case even for non-Gaussian estimation measurements. Our results show that, even in absence of entanglement, collective quantum measurements yield an enhancement in the readout of classical information, which is particularly relevant in the operating regime of low-energy signals.},

@mastersthesis{391,
	Abstract = {This thesis deals with the study of quantum networks with a complex structure, the implications this structure has in the distribution of entanglement and how their functioning can be enhanced by operating in the quantum regime. We first consider a complex network of bipartite states, both pure and mixed, and study the distribution of long-distance entanglement. Then, we move to a network with noisy channels and study the creation and distribution of large, multipartite states.
The work contained in this thesis is primarily motivated by the idea that the interplay between quantum information and complex networks may give rise to a new understanding and characterization of natural systems. Complex networks are of particular importance in communication infrastructures, as most present telecommunication networks have a complex structure. In the case of quantum networks, which are the necessary framework for distributed quantum processing and for quantum communication, it is very plausible that in the future they acquire a complex topology resembling that of existing networks, or even that methods will be developed to use current infrastructures in the quantum regime.
A central task in quantum networks is to devise strategies to distribute entanglement among its nodes. In the first part of this thesis, we consider the distribution of bipartite entanglement as an entanglement percolation process in a complex network. Within this approach, perfect entanglement is established probabilistically between two arbitrary nodes. We see that for large networks, the probability of doing so is a constant strictly greater than zero (and independent of the size of the network) if the initial amount of entanglement is above a certain critical value. Quantum mechanics offer here the possibility to change the structure of the network without need to establish new, "physical" channels. By a proper local transformation of the network, the critical entanglement can be decreased and the probability increased. We apply this transformation to complex network models with arbitrary degree distribution.
In the case of a noisy network of mixed states, we see that for some classes of states, the same approach of entanglement percolation can be used. For general mixed states, we consider a limited-path-length entanglement percolation constrained by the amount of noise in the connections. We see how complex networks still offer a great advantage in the probability of connecting two nodes.
In the second part, we move to the multipartite scenario. We study the creation and distribution of graph states with a structure that mimic the underlying communication network. In this case, we use an arbitrary complex network of noisy channels, and consider that operations and measurements are also noisy. We propose an efficient scheme to distribute and purify small subgraphs, which are then merged to reproduce the desired state. We compare this approach with two bipartite protocols that rely on a central station and full knowledge of the network structure. We show that the fidelity of the generated graphs can be written as the partition function of a classical disordered spin system (a spin glass), and its decay rate is the analog of the free energy. Applying the three protocols to a one-dimensional network and to complex networks, we see that they are all comparable, and in some cases the proposed subgraph protocol, which needs only local information of the network, performs even better.

It is important to note that, unlike in the classical case, there are many inequivalent ways to define the Renyi divergence of states, and hence the R{\'{e}}nyi capacities of channels. Our exponent is in terms of the Renyi capacities corresponding to a version of the Renyi divergences that has been introduced recently in [M{\"{u}}ller-Lennert, Dupuis, Szehr, Fehr and Tomamichel, J. Math. Phys. 54, 122203, (2013)], and [Wilde, Winter, Yang, Commun. Math. Phys. 331, (2014)]. Our result adds to the growing body of evidence that this new version is the natural definition for the purposes of strong converse problems.},

	Abstract = {Multi-armed bandit (MAB) is a class of online learning problems where a learning agent aims to maximize its expected cumulative reward while repeatedly selecting to pull arms with unknown reward distributions. In this paper, we consider a scenario in which the arms' reward distributions may change in a piecewise-stationary fashion at unknown time steps. By connecting change-detection techniques with classic UCB algorithms, we motivate and propose a learning algorithm called M-UCB, which can detect and adapt to changes, for the considered scenario. We also establish an {\$}O(\backslashsqrt{\{}MKT\backslashlog T{\}}){\$} regret bound for M-UCB, where {\$}T{\$} is the number of time steps, {\$}K{\$} is the number of arms, and {\$}M{\$} is the number of stationary segments. Comparison with the best available lower bound shows that M-UCB is nearly optimal in {\$}T{\$} up to a logarithmic factor. We also compare M-UCB with state-of-the-art algorithms in a numerical experiment based on a public Yahoo! dataset. In this experiment, M-UCB achieves about {\$}50 \backslash{\%}{\$} regret reduction with respect to the best performing state-of-the-art algorithm.},

	Abstract = {Given a quantum state with an unknown parameter, the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a measure of the amount of information that an observable can extract about the parameter. QFI also quantifies the maximum achievable precision in estimating the parameter with a given amount of resource via an inequality known as quantum Cramer-Rao bound. In this work, we describe a protocol to amplify QFI of a single target qubit precorrelated with a set of ancillary qubits. A single quadrature measurement of only ancillary qubits suffices to perform the complete quantum state tomography (QST) of the target qubit. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol using an NMR system consisting of a {\$}{\^{}}{\{}13{\}}{\$}C nuclear spin as the target qubit and three {\$}{\^{}}1{\$}H nuclear spins as ancillary qubits. We prepare the target qubit in various initial states, perform QST, and estimate the amplification of QFI in each case. We also show that the QFI-amplification scales linearly with the number of ancillary qubits and quadratically with their purity.},

Consequently the two measures are intimately connected to another operational measure, the robustness of coherence.

	Abstract = {We present a framework for studying bosonic non-Gaussian channels of continuous-variable systems. Our emphasis is on a class of channels that we call photon-added Gaussian channels, which are experimentally viable with current quantum-optical technologies. A strong motivation for considering these channels is the fact that it is compulsory to go beyond the Gaussian domain for numerous tasks in continuous-variable quantum information processing such as entanglement distillation from Gaussian states and universal quantum computation. The single-mode photon-added channels we consider are obtained by using two-mode beam splitters and squeezing operators with photon addition applied to the ancilla ports giving rise to families of non-Gaussian channels. For each such channel, we derive its operator-sum representation, indispensable in the present context. We observe that these channels are Fock preserving (coherence nongenerating). We then report two examples of activation using our scheme of photon addition, that of quantum-optical nonclassicality at outputs of channels that would otherwise output only classical states and of both the quantum and private communication capacities, hinting at far-reaching applications for quantum-optical communication. Further, we see that noisy Gaussian channels can be expressed as a convex mixture of these non-Gaussian channels. We also present other physical and information-theoretic properties of these channels.},

Nevertheless, the evaluation of a resource measure can be highly non-trivial, involving an optimisation that is often intractable analytically or intensive numerically. In this paper, we describe a general framework that provides quantitative lower bounds to any resource quantifier that satisfies the essential property of monotonicity under the corresponding set of free operations. Our framework relies on projecting all quantum states onto a restricted subset using a fixed resource non-increasing operation. The resources of the resultant family can then be evaluated using a simplified optimisation, with the result providing lower bounds on the resource contents of any state. This approach also reduces the experimental overhead, requiring only the relevant statistics of the restricted family of states. We illustrate the application of our framework by focussing on the resource of multiqubit entanglement.},

@article{Schwonnek2018,
	Abstract = {We show that for any collection of hermitian operators A1, . . . , An, and any quantum state there is a unique joint distribution on R n , with the property that the marginals of all linear combinations of the A k coincide with their quantum counterpart. We call it the Wigner distribution, because for position and momentum this property defines the standard Wigner function. In this note we discuss the application to finite dimensional systems, establish many basic properties and illustrate these by examples. The properties include the support, the location of singularities, positivity, the behaviour under symmetry groups, and informational completeness. PACS numbers: 03.65.Wj,03.65.Aa,03.65.Db Wigner functions, introduced in 1932 [1] for treating the classical limit, have become a key tool for under-standing systems with canonical degrees of freedom like position/momentum, or field quadratures in quantum op-tics. They have been particularly helpful in providing a visualisation of quantum states. While listing all the matrix elements of the density matrix is a correct way to completely characterize a state, it is hard to present this information in a way that would help to gain a use-ful insight. The Wigner function of a state contains the same information, but combines it with a localization in phase space, so that some properties, like negativity of the Wigner function, can be associated with partic-ular regions of phase space, carrying direct suggestions as to what experiments might see these effects. Accord-ingly, there is a rich literature on Wigner functions [2--12]. There are various generalizations focusing on the group theoretical structure [13--18] for which the Wigner func-tion typically is a function on the group. The aim of this note is to explore another generalization, which is directly based on the well-known fact, that the Wigner function not only gives correct marginals for canonical momentum P and position Q, but also for all real linear combinations of these operators. Replacing here the pair (P, Q) by n arbitrary hermitian operators (A 1 , . . . , A n) singles out a unique distribution of n variables, which we call the Wigner distribution. Apart from the operators A k and the state there are no arbitrary choices or param-eters in this definition. To our knowledge it has first been suggested in the in the 80s [19] (see also [20], [5, Ch. 17]), although worked out only in a very limited context. We will extend this by general results, a numerical method for obtaining graphs at any desired resolution, and fur-ther examples. We hope to thereby convey an impression of the kind of quantum structures that can be seen in this representation, and what intuitions might be based on it. Detailed proofs, more background, and further examples are provided in a companion paper [21]. A basic exam-ple, demonstrating that even in simple cases the Wigner function may display a lot of structure, is shown in Fig. 1. FIG. 1. Color online.

That is to say, given a quantum system that is in a set of possible known states according to an unknown probability law, we give strategies to estimate the individual probabilities, weights, or mixing proportions. Such strategies can be used to estimate the frequencies at which different independent signals are emitted by a source. They can also be used to estimate the weights of particular terms in a canonical decomposition of a quantum channel. The quality of these strategies is quantified by a covariance-type error matrix. According with this cost function, we give optimal strategies in both the single-shot and multiple-copy scenarios. The latter is also analyzed in the asymptotic limit of large number of copies. We give closed expressions of the error matrix for two-component quantum mixtures of qubit systems. The Fisher information plays an unusual role in the problem at hand, providing exact expressions of the minimum covariance matrix for any number of copies.},

	Abstract = {Cold atoms, driven by a laser and simultaneously coupled to the quantum field of an optical resonator, may self-organize in periodic structures. These structures are supported by the optical lattice, which emerges from the laser light they scatter into the cavity mode and form when the laser intensity exceeds a threshold value. We study theoretically the quantum ground state of these structures above the pump threshold of self-organization by mapping the atomic dynamics of the self-organized crystal to a Bose-Hubbard model. We find that the quantum ground state of the self-organized structure can be the one of a Mott insulator, depending on the pump strength of the driving laser. For very large pump strengths, where the intracavity-field intensity is maximum and one would expect a Mott-insulator state, we find intervals of parameters where the phase is compressible. These states could be realized in existing experimental setups.},

	Abstract = {The basic idea of quantum computing is surprisingly similar to that of kernel methods in machine learning, namely to efficiently perform computations in an intractably large Hilbert space. In this paper we explore some theoretical foundations of this link and show how it opens up a new avenue for the design of quantum machine learning algorithms. We interpret the process of encoding inputs in a quantum state as a nonlinear feature map that maps data to quantum Hilbert space. A quantum computer can now analyse the input data in this feature space. Based on this link, we discuss two approaches for building a quantum model for classification. In the first approach, the quantum device estimates inner products of quantum states to compute a classically intractable kernel. This kernel can be fed into any classical kernel method such as a support vector machine. In the second approach, we can use a variational quantum circuit as a linear model that classifies data explicitly in Hilbert space. We illustrate these ideas with a feature map based on squeezing in a continuous-variable system, and visualise the working principle with 2-dimensional mini-benchmark datasets.},

	Abstract = {We present a procedure to share a secret spatial direction in the absence of a common reference frame using a multipartite quantum state. The procedure guarantees that the parties can determine the direction if they perform joint measurements on the state, but fail to do so if they restrict themselves to local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We calculate the fidelity for joint measurements, give bounds on the fidelity achievable by LOCC, and prove that there is a non-vanishing gap between the two of them, even in the limit of infinitely many copies. The robustness of the procedure under particle loss is also studied. As a by-product we find bounds on the probability of discriminating by LOCC between the invariant subspaces of total angular momentum N/2 and N/2-1 in a system of N elementary spins.},

	Abstract = {Recently, the basic concept of quantum coherence (or superposition) has gained a lot of renewed attention, after Baumgratz et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 140401. (doi: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.140401)), following Aberg (http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0612146), have proposed a resource theoretic approach to quantify it. This has resulted in a large number of papers and preprints exploring various coherence monotones, and debating possible forms for the resource theory. Here, we take the view that the operational foundation of coherence in a state, be it quantum or otherwise wave mechanical, lies in the observation of interference effects. Our approach here is to consider an idealized multi-path interferometer, with a suitable detector, in such a way that the visibility of the interference pattern provides a quantitative expression of the amount of coherence in a given probe state. We present a general framework of deriving coherence measures from visibility, and demonstrate it by analysing several concrete visibility parameters, recovering some known coherence measures and obtaining some new ones.},

@article{Wilming2018,
	Abstract = {One of the outstanding problems in non-equilibrium physics is to precisely understand when and how physically relevant observables in many-body systems equilibrate under unitary time evolution. While general equilibration results have been proven that show that equilibration is generic provided that the initial state has overlap with sufficiently many energy levels, at the same time results showing that natural initial states fulfill this condition are lacking. In this work, we present stringent results for equilibration for ergodic systems in which the amount of entanglement in energy eigenstates with finite energy density grows volume-like with the system size. Concretely, we carefully formalize notions of entanglement-ergodicity in terms of R$\backslash$'enyi entropies, from which we derive that such systems equilibrate exponentially well. Our proof uses insights about R$\backslash$'enyi entropies and combines them with recent results about the probability distribution of energy in lattice systems with initial states that are weakly correlated.},

In this Rapid Communication, we analyze their thermal properties using linear irreversible thermodynamics and kinetic theory, and discuss a striking phenomenon: the possibility of simultaneously increasing or decreasing the temperatures of two systems without any supply of energy. This occurs when the filter induces a flow of particles whose energy is between the average energies of the two systems. Here we show that this selective transfer of particles does not need the action of any sort of Maxwell demon and can be carried out by passive filters without compromising the second law of thermodynamics.

That involves both the preparation of the lattice atomic gas in the desired spin state and the probing of the state. Here we demonstrate how a probing scheme based on atom-light interfaces gives access to the order parameters of nontrivial quantum magnetic phases, allowing us to characterize univocally strongly correlated magnetic systems produced in ultracold gases. This method, which is also nondemolishing, yields spatially resolved spin correlations and can be applied to bosons or fermions. As a proof of principle, we apply this method to detect the complete phase diagram displayed by a chain of (rotationally invariant) spin-1 bosons.},

Here we generalize thermodynamics to physical scenarios which allow presence of correlations, including those where strong correlations are present. We exploit the connection between information and physics, and introduce a consistent redefinition of heat dissipation by systematically accounting for the information flow from system to bath in terms of the conditional entropy. As a consequence, the formula for the Helmholtz free energy is accordingly modified. Such a remedy not only fixes the apparent violations of Landauer{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s erasure principle and the second law due to anomalous heat flows, but also leads to a generally valid reformulation of the laws of thermodynamics. In this information-theoretic approach, correlations between system and environment store work potential.

On photonic chips, paths are the natural way to encode information. To distribute those high-dimensional quantum states over large distances, transverse spatial modes, like orbital angular momentum (OAM) possessing Laguerre Gauss modes, are favourable as flying information carriers. Here we demonstrate a quantum interface between these two vibrant photonic fields. We create three-dimensional path entanglement between two photons in a non-linear crystal and use a mode sorter as the quantum interface to transfer the entanglement to the OAM degree of freedom. Thus our results show a novel, flexible way to create high-dimensional spatial mode entanglement. Moreover, they pave the way to implement broad complex quantum networks where high-dimensionally entangled states could be distributed over distant photonic chips.},

Due to unavoidable noise in the communication line, QKD is in practice limited to a distance of a few hundred kilometers and can only be extended to longer distances by use of a future quantum repeater, a small-scale quantum computer which performs iterated entanglement distillation and quantum teleportation. The existence of entangled particles that are undistillable but nevertheless useful for QKD raises the question for a quantum key repeater which works beyond the limits of entanglement distillation. In this work we show that any such apparatus is severely limited in its performance; in particular, we exhibit entanglement suitable for QKD but unsuitable for the most general quantum key repeater protocol.

We focus on multimode bosonic Gaussian channels and classify those that are nonclassicality breaking by introducing a criterion that needs to be satisfied by the matrices representing these channels. The criterion can be interpreted as a nonclassicality benchmark for these channels since it quantifies the threshold noise at which there is a complete nonclassical to classical transition of the output states, i.e., it quantifies the robustness of the nonclassicality of the outputs of the channel against Gaussian noise.

	Abstract = {The usefulness of a quantum system as a sensor is given by the quantum Fisher information (QFI) which quantifies the sensitivity of its quantum states to perturbations. In particular, for unitary perturbations useful quantum states are necessarily coherent. Quantum enhanced sensing with many-body states relies on multipartite entanglement (MPE), and therefore QFI is used as an entanglement witness. Here we show that for systems with a fixed local charge (for example fixed density) the connection between QFI and MPE simplifies. In this case, QFI can become a faithful witness of MPE, as a consequence of the emerging direct relation between MPE and coherence in a quantum state, and coherence (as quantified by relative entropy) becomes a faithful upper bound for the relative entropy MPE. When the local charge is not fixed but conserved, QFI becomes a faithful witness of multipartite quantum discord (i.e. quantumness) and coherence becomes its faithful upper bound. Analogously, we show how the bipartite entanglement (BPE) of a fixed-charge state can be witnessed by the QFI related to unitary perturbations of the bipartition, while the corresponding block coherence (i.e., charge asymmetry between partitions) serves as a lower bound on BPE of formation. As estimating QFI is difficult for mixed states of open quantum systems, we adapt a recently introduced protocol that measures QFI of pure states and provides a lower bound for the QFI in open systems. When conservation laws are present, this lower bound can also be a faithful witness of MPE, and furthermore a lower bound of a BPE measure. We illustrate these general results with an application to the problem of detecting the growth of entanglement in a many-body localised system with and without dissipation.},

	Abstract = {The practical successes of deep neural networks have not been matched by theoretical progress that satisfyingly explains their behavior. In this work, we study the information bottleneck (IB) theory of deep learning, which makes three specific claims: first, that deep networks undergo two distinct phases consisting of an initial fitting phase and a subsequent compression phase; second, that the compression phase is causally related to the excellent generalization performance of deep networks; and third, that the compression phase occurs due to the diffusion-like behavior of stochastic gradient descent. Here we show that none of these claims hold true in the general case. Through a combination of analytical results and simulation, we demonstrate that the information plane trajectory is predominantly a function of the neural nonlinearity employed: double-sided saturating nonlinearities like tanh yield a compression phase as neural activations enter the saturation regime, but linear activation functions and single-sided saturating nonlinearities like the widely used ReLU in fact do not. Moreover, we find that there is no evident causal connection between compression and generalization: networks that do not compress are still capable of generalization, and vice versa. Next, we show that the compression phase, when it exists, does not arise from stochasticity in training by demonstrating that we can replicate the IB findings using full batch gradient descent rather than stochastic gradient descent. Finally, we show that when an input domain consists of a subset of task-relevant and task-irrelevant information, hidden representations do compress the task-irrelevant information, although the overall information about the input may monotonically increase with training time, and that this compression happens concurrently with the fitting process rather than during a subsequent compression period.},

	Abstract = {Quantum correlations are at the heart of many applications in quantum information science and, at the same time, they form the basis for discussions about genuine quantum effects and their difference to classical physics. On one hand, entanglement theory provides the tools to quantify correlations in information processing and many results have been obtained to discriminate useful entanglement, which can be distilled to a pure form, from bound entanglement, being of limited use in many applications. On the other hand, for discriminating quantum phenomena from their classical counterparts, Schr{\"{o}}dinger and Bell introduced the notions of steering and local hidden variable models. We provide a method to generate systematically bound entangled quantum states which can still be used for steering and therefore to rule out local hidden state models. This sheds light on the relations between the various views on quantum correlations and disproves a widespread conjecture known as the stronger Peres conjecture. For practical applications, it implies that even the weakest form of entanglement can be certified in a semi-device independent way.},

	Abstract = {Markovian approximation is a widely-employed idea in descriptions of the dynamics of open quantum systems (OQSs). Although it is usually claimed to be a concept inspired by classical Markovianity, the term quantum Markovianity is used inconsistently and often unrigorously in the literature. In this report we compare the descriptions of classical stochastic processes and quantum stochastic processes (as arising in OQSs), and show that there are inherent differences that lead to the non-trivial problem of characterizing quantum non-Markovianity. Rather than proposing a single definition of quantum Markovianity, we study a host of Markov-related concepts in the quantum regime. Some of these concepts have long been used in quantum theory, such as quantum white noise, factorization approximation, divisibility, Lindblad master equation, etc.. Others are first proposed in this report, including those we call past-future independence, no (quantum) information backflow, and composability. All of these concepts are defined under a unified framework, which allows us to rigorously build hierarchy relations among them. With various examples, we argue that the current most often used definitions of quantum Markovianity in the literature do not fully capture the memoryless property of OQSs. In fact, quantum non-Markovianity is highly context-dependent. The results in this report, summarized as a hierarchy figure, bring clarity to the nature of quantum non-Markovianity.},

	Abstract = {Quantum metrology overcomes standard precision limits and plays a central role in science and technology. Practically it is vulnerable to imperfections such as decoherence. Here, we demonstrate quantum metrology for noisy channels such that entanglement with ancillary qubits enhances the quantum Fisher information for phase estimation but not otherwise. Our photonic experiment covers a range of noise for various types of channels, including for two randomly alternating channels such that assisted entanglement fails for each noisy channel individually. We have simulated noisy channels by implementing space-multiplexed dual interferometers with quantum photonic inputs. We have demonstrated the advantage of entanglement-assisted protocols in phase estimation experiment run with either single-probe or multi-probe approach. These results establish that entanglement with ancillae is a valuable approach for delivering quantum-enhanced metrology. Our new approach to entanglement-assisted quantum metrology via a simple linear-optical interferometric network with easy-to-prepare photonic inputs provides a path towards practical quantum metrology.},

	Abstract = {A spin gas is a natural extension of a classical gas. It consists of a large number of particles whose (random) motion is described classically, but, in addition, have internal (quantum mechanical) degrees of freedom that interact during collisions. For specific types of quantum interactions we determine the entanglement that occurs naturally in such systems. We analyze how the evolution of the quantum state is determined by the underlying classical kinematics of the gas. For the Boltzmann gas, we calculate the rate at which entanglement is produced and characterize the entanglement properties of the equilibrium state.},

	Abstract = {We determine the quantum ground-state properties of ultracold bosonic atoms interacting with the mode of a high-finesse resonator. The atoms are confined by an external optical lattice, whose period is incommensurate with the cavity mode wavelength, and are driven by a transverse laser, which is resonant with the cavity mode. While for pointlike atoms photon scattering into the cavity is suppressed, for sufficiently strong lasers quantum fluctuations can support the buildup of an intracavity field, which in turn amplifies quantum fluctuations. The dynamics is described by a Bose-Hubbard model where the coefficients due to the cavity field depend on the atomic density at all lattice sites. Quantum Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field calculations show that, for large parameter regions, cavity backaction forces the atoms into clusters with a checkerboard density distribution. Here, the ground state lacks superfluidity and possesses finite compressibility, typical of a Bose glass. This system constitutes a novel setting where quantum fluctuations give rise to effects usually associated with disorder.},

The other approach requires the differentiability of a regularized R{\'{e}}nyi $\alpha$-divergence in the parameter $\alpha$; typical examples of such states include temperature states of non-interacting fermionic lattice systems, and classical irreducible Markov chains. In all cases, we get that the strong converse exponent is equal to the Hoeffding divergence, which in turn is obtained from the regularized R{\'{e}}nyi divergences of the two states.},

Inspired by quantum logic approach of Tylec and Ku$\backslash$'{\{}s{\}} (J. Phys. A: Math.

We then show that this seemingly mild extension completely rules out supraquantum correlations. The resulting system admits precisely quantum mechanical correlations of two qubits. We also consider non-maximally entangled measurements, the resulting system interpolating between quantum and full nosignaling theory. Our study paves a way to a general programme of interpolating between non-signaling boxes and quantum mechanics.},

	Abstract = {Consider observing a collection of discrete events within a network that reflect how network nodes influence one another. Such data are common in spike trains recorded from biological neural networks, interactions within a social network, and a variety of other settings. Data of this form may be modeled as self-exciting point processes, in which the likelihood of future events depends on the past events. This paper addresses the problem of estimating self-excitation parameters and inferring the underlying functional network structure from self-exciting point process data. Past work in this area was limited by strong assumptions which are addressed by the novel approach here. Specifically, in this paper we (1) incorporate saturation in a point process model which both ensures stability and models non-linear thresholding effects; (2) impose general low-dimensional structural assumptions that include sparsity, group sparsity and low-rankness that allows bounds to be developed in the high-dimensional setting; and (3) incorporate long-range memory effects through moving average and higher-order auto-regressive components. Using our general framework, we provide a number of novel theoretical guarantees for high-dimensional self-exciting point processes that reflect the role played by the underlying network structure and long-term memory. We also provide simulations and real data examples to support our methodology and main results.},

While the quantification of the corresponding properties in mixed states is important both from a theoretical and a practical point of view, it is considerably more difficult, and methods beyond estimates for the concurrence are elusive. In particular this holds for a quantitative assessment of the most valuable resource, the forms of entanglement that can only exist in high-dimensional systems. We derive a framework for lower bounding the appropriate measure of entanglement, the so-called G-concurrence, through few local measurements.

	Abstract = {Entanglementbetween two macroscopic atomic ensembles induced by measurement on anancillary light system has proven to be a powerful methodfor engineering quantum memories and quantum state transfer. Here weinvestigate the feasibility of such methods for generation, manipulation, anddetection of genuine multipartite entanglement (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and clusterlike states) betweenmesoscopic atomic ensembles without the need of individual addressing ofthe samples. Our results extend in a nontrivial way theEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement between two macroscopic gas samples reported experimentally in[B. Julsgaard, A. Kozhekin, and E. Polzik, Nature (London) 413,400 (2001)]. We find that under realistic conditions, a secondorthogonal light pulse interacting with the atomic samples, can modifyand even reverse the entangling action of the first oneleaving the samples in a separable state. {\textcopyright}2009 The American Physical Society},

@article{Burenkov2018,
	Abstract = {Computational imaging through scatter generally is accomplished by first characterizing the scattering medium so that its forward operator is obtained; and then imposing additional priors in the form of regularizers on the reconstruction functional so as to improve the condition of the originally ill-posed inverse problem. In the functional, the forward operator and regularizer must be entered explicitly or parametrically (e.g. scattering matrices and dictionaries, respectively.) However, the process of determining these representations is often incomplete, prone to errors, or infeasible. Recently, deep learning architectures have been proposed to instead learn both the forward operator and regularizer through examples. Here, we propose for the first time, to our knowledge, a convolutional neural network architecture called "IDiffNet" for the problem of imaging through diffuse media and demonstrate that IDiffNet has superior generalization capability through extensive tests with well-calibrated diffusers. We found that the Negative Pearson Correlation Coefficient loss function for training is more appropriate for spatially sparse objects and strong scattering conditions. Our results show that the convolutional architecture is robust to the choice of prior, as demonstrated by the use of multiple training and testing object databases, and capable of achieving higher space-bandwidth product reconstructions than previously reported.},

	Abstract = {Since the dawn of quantum theory, coherence was attributed as a key to understand the weirdness of fundamental concepts like the wave-particle duality and the Stern-Gerlach experiment. Recently, based on a resource theory approach, the notion of quantum coherence was revisited and a plethora of coherence quantifiers were proposed. In this work, we address this issue using the language of coherence orders, developed by the NMR community. This allowed us to investigate the role played by different subspaces of the Hilbert-Schmidt space into physical processes and quantum protocols. We found some links between decoherence and each coherence order. Moreover, we propose a sufficient and straightforward criterion to testify the usefulness of a given state for quantum enhanced phase estimation, relying on a minimal set of elements belonging to the density matrix.},

To this aim we first exploit rotationally invariant states as a test bed to detect genuine tripartite entanglement beyond the nearest neighbor in spin-1/2 models. Then we construct in a closed analytical form a family of entanglement witnesses which provides a sufficient condition to determine if a state of a many-body system formed by an arbitrary number of spin-1/2 particles possesses genuine tripartite entanglement, independently of the details of the model. We illustrate our method by analyzing in detail the anisotropic XXZ spin chain close to its phase transitions, where we demonstrate the presence of long-range multipartite entanglement near the critical point and the breaking of the symmetries associated with the quantum phase transition.},

A central idea of our approach is that the natural generalization of the concept of eigenspace of the Hamiltonian in the case of Markovian dynamics is a noiseless subsystem with a minimal noisy cofactor. Unlike previous attempts to define adiabaticity for open systems, our approach deals exclusively with physical entities and provides a simple, intuitive picture at the underlying Hilbert-space level, linking the notion of adiabaticity to the theory of noiseless subsystems. As an application of our theory, we propose a framework for decoherence-assisted computation in noiseless codes under general Markovian noise. We also formulate a dissipation-driven approach to holonomic computation based on adiabatic dragging of subsystems that is generally not achievable by non-dissipative means.},

	Abstract = {We consider the multiple hypothesis testing problem for symmetric quantum state discrimination between r given states $\sigma${\_}1,...,$\sigma${\_}r. By splitting up the overall test into multiple binary tests in various ways we obtain a number of upper bounds on the optimal error probability in terms of the binary error probabilities. These upper bounds allow us to deduce various bounds on the asymptotic error rate, for which it has been hypothesised that it is given by the multi-hypothesis quantum Chernoff bound (or Chernoff divergence) C($\sigma${\_}1,...,$\sigma${\_}r), as recently introduced by Nussbaum and Szko{\l}a in analogy with Salikhov{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s classical multi-hypothesis Chernoff bound. This quantity is defined as the minimum of the pairwise binary Chernoff divergences min{\_}{\{}j{\textless}k{\}}C($\sigma${\_}j,$\sigma${\_}k). It was known already that the optimal asymptotic rate must lie between C/3 and C, and that for certain classes of sets of states the bound is actually achieved. It was known to be achieved, in particular, when the state pair that is closest together in Chernoff divergence is more than 6 times closer than the next closest pair. Our results improve on this in two ways. Firstly, we show that the optimal asymptotic rate must lie between C/2 and C. Secondly, we show that the Chernoff bound is already achieved when the closest state pair is more than 2 times closer than the next closest pair. We also show that the Chernoff bound is achieved when at least r-2 of the states are pure, improving on a previous result by Nussbaum and Szko{\l}a. Finally, we indicate a number of potential pathways along which a proof (or disproof) may eventually be found that the multi-hypothesis quantum Chernoff bound is always achieved.},

	Abstract = {We investigate relations between the ranks of marginals of multipartite quantum states. These are the Schmidt ranks across all possible bipartitions and constitute a natural quantification of multipartite entanglement dimensionality. We show that there exist inequalities constraining the possible distribution of ranks. This is analogous to the case of von Neumann entropy ($\alpha$-R{\'{e}}nyi entropy for $\alpha$=1), where nontrivial inequalities constraining the distribution of entropies (such as e.g. strong subadditivity) are known. It was also recently discovered that all other $\alpha$-R{\'{e}}nyi entropies for $\alpha$∈(0,1)∪(1,{\$}\backslashinfty{\$}) satisfy only one trivial linear inequality (non-negativity) and the distribution of entropies for $\alpha$∈(0,1) is completely unconstrained beyond non-negativity. Our result resolves an important open question by showing that also the case of $\alpha$=0 (logarithm of the rank) is restricted by nontrivial linear relations and thus the cases of von Neumann entropy (i.e., $\alpha$=1) and 0-R{\'{e}}nyi entropy are exceptionally interesting measures of entanglement in the multipartite setting.},

	Abstract = {Lidar is a well known optical technology for measuring a target's range and radial velocity. We describe two lidar systems that use entanglement between transmitted signals and retained idlers to obtain significant quantum enhancements in simultaneous measurement of these parameters. The first entanglement-enhanced lidar circumvents the Arthurs-Kelly uncertainty relation for simultaneous measurement of range and radial velocity from detection of a single photon returned from the target. This performance presumes there is no extraneous (background) light, but is robust to the roundtrip loss incurred by the signal photons. The second entanglement-enhanced lidar---which requires a lossless, noiseless environment---realizes Heisenberg-limited accuracies for both its range and radial-velocity measurements, i.e., their root-mean-square estimation errors are both proportional to {\$}1/M{\$} when {\$}M{\$} signal photons are transmitted. These two lidars derive their entanglement-based enhancements from use of a unitary transformation that takes a signal-idler photon pair with frequencies {\$}\backslashomega{\_}S{\$} and {\$}\backslashomega{\_}I{\$} and converts it to a signal-idler photon pair whose frequencies are {\$}(\backslashomega{\_}S + \backslashomega{\_}I)/2{\$} and {\$}\backslashomega{\_}S-\backslashomega{\_}I{\$}. Insight into how this transformation provides its benefits is provided through an analogy to superdense coding.},

	Abstract = {Typical studies of quantum error correction assume probabilistic Pauli noise, largely because it is relatively easy to analyze and simulate. Consequently, the effective logical noise due to physically realistic coherent errors is relatively unknown. Here we prove that encoding a system in a stabilizer code and measuring error syndromes decoheres errors, that is, converts coherent errors to probabilistic Pauli errors, even when no recovery operations are applied. Two practical consequences are that the error rate in a logical circuit is well-quantified by the average gate fidelity at the logical level and that essentially optimal recovery operators can be determined by independently optimizing the logical fidelity of the effective noise per syndrome.},

In this approach, we train a single model that finds near-optimal solutions for problem instances sampled from a given distribution, only by observing the reward signals and following feasibility rules. Our model represents a parameterized stochastic policy, and by applying a policy gradient algorithm to optimize its parameters, the trained model produces the solution as a sequence of consecutive actions in real time, without the need to re-train for every new problem instance. Our method is faster in both training and inference than a recent method that solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), with nearly identical solution quality. On the more general VRP, our approach outperforms classical heuristics on medium-sized instances in both solution quality and computation time (after training). Our proposed framework can be applied to variants of the VRP such as the stochastic VRP, and has the potential to be applied more generally to combinatorial optimization problems.},

By solving the Lindblad master equation, we calculate the resulted interference pattern of the system. Interestingly, we show that even if one considers the decoherence effect, the system will keep some of its quantum properties. Indeed, the thermalization process does not completely leave the system in a classical state and the system keeps some of its coherency. Such an effect can be detected, when the frequency of the central system is high and the temperature is low, even with zero phase angle. This observation makes the quantum-to-classical transition remain as a vague notion in decoherence theory. By introducing an entropy measure, we express the influence of the bath as a maximization of system's entropy instead of classicalization of the state.},

@article{garcia-pintos_equilibration_2017,
	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We address the problem of understanding, from first principles, the conditions under which a quantum system equilibrates rapidly with respect to a concrete observable. On the one hand, previously known general upper bounds on the time scales of equilibration were unrealistically long, with times scaling linearly with the dimension of the Hilbert space. These bounds proved to be tight since particular constructions of observables scaling in this way were found. On the other hand, the computed equilibration time scales for certain classes of typical measurements, or under the evolution of typical Hamiltonians, are unrealistically short. However, most physically relevant situations fall outside these two classes. In this paper, we provide a new upper bound on the equilibration time scales which, under some physically reasonable conditions, give much more realistic results than previously known. In particular, we apply this result to the paradigmatic case of a system interacting with a thermal bath, where we obtain an upper bound for the equilibration time scale independent of the size of the bath.

@article{Figueroa2018,
	Abstract = {It is common, when dealing with quantum processes involving a subsystem of a much larger com-posite closed system, to treat them as effectively memory-less (Markovian). While open systems the-ory tells us that non-Markovian processes should be the norm, the ubiquity of Markovian processes is undeniable. Here, without resorting to the Born-Markov assumption of weak coupling or making any approximations, we formally prove that typical processes are exponentially close to Markovian ones when the subsystem is sufficiently small compared to the remainder of the composite. We also show that, for a fixed global system size, it may not be possible to neglect non-Markovian effects when the process is allowed to continue for long enough. However, detecting non-Markovianity for such processes would usually require non-trivial entangling resources. Our results have foundational importance, as they give birth to Markov processes from composite closed dynamics.},

The first one, {\$}\backslashboldsymbol{\{}\backslashrho{\_}{\{}{\_}{\{}T{\}}{\}}{\}}{\$}, provides a representation of a generic full-rank density matrix in terms of the parameters of the discrimination problem, i.e. the mutual overlaps {\$}\backslashgamma{\_}{\{}ij{\}}=\backslashlangle{\{}\backslashphi{\_}i{\}}|{\{}\backslashphi{\_}j{\}}\backslashrangle{\$} and the occurrence probabilities {\$}\backslash{\{}\backslasheta{\_}i\backslash{\}}{\$}. The second one on the other hand is defined as a diagonal density matrix {\$}\backslashboldsymbol{\{}\backslasheta{\_}p{\}}{\$} with the diagonal entries given by the probabilities {\$}\backslash{\{}\backslasheta{\_}i\backslash{\}}{\$} with the ordering induced by the permutation {\$}p{\$} of the probabilities. When the set {\$}\backslashPhi{\$} can be discriminated unambiguously with probability one then {\$}\backslashboldsymbol{\{}\backslashrho{\_}{\{}{\_}{\{}T{\}}{\}}{\}} \backslashrightarrow \backslashboldsymbol{\{}\backslasheta{\_}{\{}{\{}p{\}}{\}}{\}}{\$}. On the other hand if the set lacks its independency and cannot be discriminated anymore the distinguishability of the pair, measured by the fidelity {\$}F(\backslashboldsymbol{\{}\backslashrho{\_}{\{}{\_}{\{}T{\}}{\}}{\}}, \backslashboldsymbol{\{}\backslasheta{\_}{\{}{\{}p{\}}{\}}{\}}){\$}, becomes minimum. This enables one to associate to each discrimination problem {\$}\backslashPhi{\_}{\{}\backslasheta{\}}{\$} a unique distinguishability problem between two states {\$}\backslashboldsymbol{\{}\backslashrho{\_}{\{}{\_}{\{}T{\}}{\}}{\}}{\$} and {\$}\backslashboldsymbol{\{}\backslasheta{\_}{\{}{\{}p{\}}{\}}{\}}{\$}, and define the maximum fidelity between them (maximum over all permutations of the probabilities {\$}\backslash{\{}\backslasheta{\_}i\backslash{\}}{\$}) as the extent to which the set is discriminable. Calculating this quantity does not require any optimization and we study its behaviour with some examples.},

In the quantum realm, it is a new primitive where one aims at identifying the point where a source that supposedly prepares a sequence of particles in identical quantum states starts preparing a mutated one. We obtain the optimal procedure to identify the change point with certainty-naturally at the price of having a certain probability of getting an inconclusive answer. We obtain the analytical form of the optimal probability of successful identification for any length of the particle sequence. We show that the conditional success probabilities of identifying each possible change point show an unexpected oscillatory behavior.

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Degradable quantum channels are an important class of completely positive trace-preserving maps. Among other properties, they offer a single-letter formula for the quantum and the private classical capacity and are characterized by the fact that a complementary channel can be obtained from the channel by applying a degrading channel. In this paper, we introduce the concept of approximate degradable channels, which satisfy this condition up to some finite epsilon {\textgreater}= 0. That is, there exists a degrading channel which upon composition with the channel is e-close in the diamond norm to the complementary channel. We show that for any fixed channel the smallest such e can be efficiently determined via a semidefinite program. Moreover, these approximate degradable channels also approximately inherit all other properties of degradable channels. As an application, we derive improved upper bounds to the quantum and private classical capacity for certain channels of interest in quantum communication.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

	Abstract = {Structural defects in ion crystals can be formed during a linear quench of the transverse trapping frequency across the mechanical instability from a linear chain to the zigzag structure. The density of defects after the sweep can be conveniently described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. In particular, the number of kinks in the zigzag ordering can be derived from a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation for the order parameter, here the zigzag transverse size, under the assumption that the ions are continuously laser cooled. In a linear Paul trap the transition becomes inhomogeneous, being the charge density larger in the center and more rarefied at the edges. During the linear quench the mechanical instability is first crossed in the center of the chain, and a front, at which the mechanical instability is crossed during the quench, is identified which propagates along the chain from the center to the edges. If the velocity of this front is smaller than the sound velocity, the dynamics becomes adiabatic even in the thermodynamic limit and no defect is produced. Otherwise, the nucleation of kinks is reduced with respect to the case in which the charges are homogeneously distributed, leading to a new scaling of the density of kinks with the quenching rate. The analytical predictions are verified numerically by integrating the Langevin equations of motion of the ions, in presence of a time-dependent transverse confinement. We argue that the non-equilibrium dynamics of an ion chain in a Paul trap constitutes an ideal scenario to test the inhomogeneous extension of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which lacks experimental evidence to date. },

In particular, we define and study the classical capacity of a unitary interaction with helper, in two variants: one where the helper can only prepare separable states across many channel uses, and one without this restriction. Furthermore, two even more powerful scenarios of pre-shared entanglement between helper and receiver, and of classical communication between sender and helper (making them conferencing encoders) are considered.},

A non-counterfactual scheme (Aharonov and Vaidman 2003) with strong rather than weak measurements for verifying the particle's subtle presence in two boxes. ii) A realization of the latter (Okamoto and Takeuchi 2016). iii) A dynamic version (Aharonov et al. 2017), with disappearance and reappearance of the particle. We now combine these advances together. Using photonic quantum routers the particle acts like a quantum "shutter." It is initially split between Boxes A, B and C, the latter located far away from the former two. The shutter particle's whereabouts can then be followed by a probe photon, split in both space and time and reflected by the shutter in its varying locations. Measuring the former is expected to reveal the following time-evolution: The shutter particle was, with certainty, in boxes A+C at t1, then only in C at t2, and finally in B+C at t3. Another branch of the split probe photon can show that boxes A+B were empty at t2. A Bell-like theorem applied to this experiment challenges any alternative interpretation that avoids disappearance-reappearance in favor of local hidden variables.},

There, the CMF method yields two supersolid phases compatible with those present in the spin-1/2 XXZ model onto which the spin-1 system maps. Between these two supersolid phases, the three-sublattice order is broken and the results of the CMF approach depend heavily on the geometry and size of the cluster.

General rules are formulated allowing for the explicit calculation of quantum probabilities representing the fraction of decision makers preferring the considered prospects. This provides a method to quantitatively predict decision-maker choices, including the cases of games with high uncertainty for which the classical expected utility theory fails.

We consider optimum state separation of two known pure states in the general case where the known states have arbitrary a priori probabilities.

We present the corresponding analytical solutions in various forms. In the limit of perfect state separation, which is equivalent to unambiguous state discrimination, the solution exhibits a phenomenon analogous to a second order symmetry breaking phase transition.

	Abstract = {Thermodynamics and information have intricate inter-relations. The justification of the fact that information is physical, is done by inter-linking information and thermodynamics - through Landauer's principle. This modern approach towards information recently has improved our understanding of thermodynamics, both in classical and quantum domains. Here we show thermodynamics as a consequence of information conservation. Our approach can be applied to most general situations, where systems and thermal-baths could be quantum, of arbitrary sizes and even could posses inter-system correlations. The approach does not rely on an a priori predetermined temperature associated to a thermal bath, which is not meaningful for finite-size cases. Hence, the thermal-baths and systems are not different, rather both are treated on an equal footing. This results in a "temperature"-independent formulation of thermodynamics. We exploit the fact that, for a fix amount of coarse-grained information, measured by the von Neumann entropy, any system can be transformed to a state that possesses minimal energy, without changing its entropy. This state is known as a completely passive state, which assumes Boltzmann-Gibb's canonical form with an intrinsic temperature. This leads us to introduce the notions of bound and free energy, which we further use to quantify heat and work respectively. With this guiding principle of information conservation, we develop universal notions of equilibrium, heat and work, Landauer's principle and also universal fundamental laws of thermodynamics. We show that the maximum efficiency of a quantum engine, equipped with a finite baths, is in general lower than that of an ideal Carnot's engine. We also introduce a resource theoretic framework for intrinsic-temperature based thermodynamics, within which we address the problem of work extraction and state transformations.},

	Abstract = {An autonomous quantum thermal machine comprising a trapped atom or ion placed inside an optical cavity is proposed and analysed. Such a machine can operate as a heat engine whose working medium is the quantised atomic motion or as an absorption refrigerator that cools without any work input. Focusing on the refrigerator mode, we predict that it is possible with state-of-the-art technology to cool a trapped ion almost to its motional ground state using a thermal light source such as sunlight. We nonetheless find that a laser or a similar reference system is necessary to stabilise the cavity frequencies. Furthermore, we establish a direct and heretofore unacknowledged connection between the abstract theory of quantum absorption refrigerators and practical sideband cooling techniques. We also highlight and clarify some assumptions underlying several recent theoretical studies on self-contained quantum engines and refrigerators. Our work indicates that cavity quantum electrodynamics is a promising and versatile experimental platform for the study of autonomous thermal machines in the quantum domain.},

	Abstract = {The different quantum phases appearing in strongly correlated systems as well as their transitions are closely related to the entanglement shared between their constituents. In 1D systems, it is well established that the entanglement spectrum is linked to the symmetries that protect the different quantum phases. This relation extends even further at the phase transitions where a direct link associates the entanglement spectrum to the conformal field theory describing the former. For 2D systems much less is known. The lattice geometry becomes a crucial aspect to consider when studying entanglement and phase transitions. Here, we analyze the entanglement properties of triangular spin lattice models by also considering concepts borrowed from quantum information theory such as geometric entanglement.},

	Abstract = {We demonstrate identification of position, material, orientation, and shape of objects imaged by a 85 Rb atomic magnetometer performing electromagnetic induction imaging supported by machine learning. Machine learning maximizes the information extracted from the images created by the magnetometer, demonstrating the use of hidden data. Localization 2.6 times better than the spatial resolution of the imaging system and successful classification up to 97{\%} are obtained. This circumvents the need of solving the inverse problem and demonstrates the extension of machine learning to diffusive systems, such as low-frequency electrodynamics in media. Automated collection of task-relevant information from quantum-based electromagnetic imaging will have a relevant impact from biomedicine to security. Electromagnetic induction imaging (EMI), or magnetic induction tomography (MIT), with atomic magnetometers (AMs) was recently demonstrated for mapping the electric conductivity of objects and imaging of metallic samples [1--4]. EMI and its classical counterpart with conventional magnetic field sensors [5] rely on the detection of the ac magnetic field generated by eddy currents excited in media. This poses severe problems for image reconstruction, par-ticularly in cluttered contexts or with low-conductivity specimens. The inherently diffusive and nonlinear nature of low-frequency electrodynamics in media makes conven-tional ray-optics analysis impossible. Consequently, back-projection approaches [6] are of limited use. Furthermore, the solution of the inverse problem for low-frequency electro-magnetics is ill posed, undetermined, and computationally challenging [7]. Ultimately, these limitations reduce the attainable information from EMI and its spatial resolution. In this Letter, we propose and demonstrate machine learning (ML) [8] as a method for enhancing the EMI capabilities and circumventing the problem of image reconstruction and interpretation. ML has thus far been applied in a wealth of fields [9--17]. ML-aided security screening in the X band [18,19] and biomedical imaging have been widely demonstrated [20,21], as well as image reconstruction through scattering media in the optical band [22,23]. All these applications to well-established imaging technologies are underpinned by linear systems, with raylike propagation. Here we present proof-of-concept demonstrations of EMI by an AM with metallic and nonmetallic samples. Their localization and material, orientation, and shape classifica-tion from low-resolution images is aided by ML. AM-EMI supported by ML maximizes the information obtained from the images and provides relevant data for specific tasks, without requiring the inverse problem. This improves or enables identification of critical features, such as structural defects in nondestructive evaluation [1,3], concealed threats in screening applications [4], or conductivity anomalies in biological tissues [24]. New perspectives open up for high-performance imaging based on EMI, in particular, with AMs, with a relevant impact on science and society. In our setup, imaging relies on the position-resolved detection of the secondary magnetic field produced by eddy currents induced in the sample of interest by an ac magnetic field (B rf), oscillating at $\nu$ rf ¼ 200 kHz with amplitude 1.9 × 10 −8 T. This primary field is produced by a pair of 180 mm diameter Helmholtz coils. The imaged object's response is detected by a 85 Rb radio-frequency optically pumped AM, coherently driven by the same field (B rf), and described in [1,4]. We recall that a $\sigma$ þ -polarized beam},

We show that this system undergoes a transition from Markovian to non-Markovian dynamics, which can be controlled by changing key parameters such as the condensate scattering length. In this way, one can realize a quantum simulator of both Markovian and non-Markovian open quantum systems, the latter ones being characterized by a reverse flow of information from the background gas (reservoir) to the impurity (system).},

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Time remains one of the least well-understood concepts in physics, most notably in quantum mechanics. A central goal is to find the fundamental limits of measuring time. One of the main obstacles is the fact that time is not an observable and thus has to be measured indirectly. Here, we explore these questions by introducing a model of time measurements that is complete and autonomous. Specifically, our autonomous quantum clock consists of a system out of thermal equilibrium{\{}$\backslash$textemdash{\}}a prerequisite for any system to function as a clock{\{}$\backslash$textemdash{\}}powered by minimal resources, namely, two thermal baths at different temperatures. Through a detailed analysis of this specific clock model, we find that the laws of thermodynamics dictate a trade-off between the amount of dissipated heat and the clock{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s performance in terms of its accuracy and resolution. Our results furthermore imply that a fundamental entropy production is associated with the operation of any autonomous quantum clock, assuming that quantum machines cannot achieve perfect efficiency at finite power. More generally, autonomous clocks provide a natural framework for the exploration of fundamental questions about time in quantum theory and beyond.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

Indeed, the reference system is composed of the same types of subsystems as the original system and is finite for any desired accuracy. In addition, the interaction with the reference frame can be broken down into two-body terms coupling the system to one of the reference frame subsystems at a time.

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating the temperature T of a very cold equilibrium sample. The temperature estimates are drawn from measurements performed on a quantum Brownian probe strongly coupled to it. We model this scenario by resorting to the canonical Caldeira-Leggett Hamiltonian and find analytically the exact stationary state of the probe for arbitrary coupling strength. In general, the probe does not reach thermal equilibrium with the sample, due to their nonperturbative interaction. We argue that this is advantageous for low-temperature thermometry, as we show in our model that (i) the thermometric precision at low T can be significantly enhanced by strengthening the probe-sampling coupling, (ii) the variance of a suitable quadrature of our Brownian thermometer can yield temperature estimates with nearly minimal statistical uncertainty, and (iii) the spectral density of the probe-sample coupling may be engineered to further improve thermometric performance. These observations may find applications in practical nanoscale thermometry at low temperatures-a regime which is particularly relevant to quantum technologies.},

	Abstract = {Quantum simulators have the exciting prospect of giving access to real-time dynamics of lattice gauge theories, in particular in regimes that are difficult to compute on classical computers. Future progress towards scalable quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories, however, hinges crucially on the efficient use of experimental resources. As we argue in this work, due to the fundamental non-uniqueness of discretizing the relativistic Dirac Hamiltonian, the lattice representation of gauge theories allows for an optimization that up to now has been left unexplored. We exemplify our discussion with lattice quantum electrodynamics in two-dimensional space-time, where we show that the formulation through Wilson fermions provides several advantages over the previously considered staggered fermions. Notably, it enables a strongly simplified optical lattice setup and it reduces the number of degrees of freedom required to simulate dynamical gauge fields. Exploiting the optimal representation, we propose an experiment based on a mixture of ultracold atoms trapped in a tilted optical lattice. Using numerical benchmark simulations, we demonstrate that a state-of-the-art quantum simulator may access the Schwinger mechanism and map out its non-perturbative onset.},

We illustrate our approach by focussing on the Heisenberg chain for spin-1 bosons in the presence of a SU(2) symmetry breaking field. We explain how using the light signal obtained via homodyne detection one can reconstruct the phase diagram of the model.

	Abstract = {Quantum metrology offers a quadratic advantage over classical approaches to parameter estimation problems by utilising entanglement and nonclassicality. However, the hurdle of actually implementing the necessary quantum probe states and measurements, which vary drastically for different metrological scenarios, is usually not taken into account. We show that for a wide range of tasks in metrology, 2D cluster states (a particular family of states useful for measurement-based quantum computation) can serve as flexible resources that allow one to efficiently prepare any required state for sensing, and perform appropriate (entangled) measurements using only single qubit operations. Crucially, the overhead in the number of qubits is less than quadratic, thus preserving the quantum scaling advantage. This is ensured by using a compression to a logarithmically sized space that contains all relevant information for sensing. We specifically demonstrate how our method can be used to obtain optimal scaling for phase and frequency estimation in local estimation problems, as well as for the Bayesian equivalents with Gaussian priors of varying widths. Furthermore, we show that in the paradigmatic case of local phase estimation 1D cluster states are sufficient for optimal state preparation and measurement.},

Here, we address the question whether generic measurements can be implemented efficiently if we have access to a certain set of exper-imentally realizable measurements and can extend it through time evolution. For the latter, two scenarios are considered (a) evolution according to unitary circuits and (b) evolution due to Hamil-tonians that we can control in a time-dependent fashion. We find that the time needed to realize a certain measurement to a predefined accuracy scales in general exponentially with the system size -- posing a fundamental limitation. The argument is based, on the construction of $\epsilon$-packings for manifolds of observables with identical spectra and a comparison of their cardinalities to those of $\epsilon$-coverings for quantum circuits and unitary time-evolution operators. The former is related to the study of Grassmann manifolds.},

	Abstract = {This paper studies the difficulty of discriminating between an arbitrary quantum channel and a "replacer" channel that discards its input and replaces it with a fixed state. The results obtained here generalize those known in the theory of quantum hypothesis testing for binary state discrimination. We show that, in this particular setting, the most general adaptive discrimination strategies provide no asymptotic advantage over non-adaptive tensor-power strategies. This conclusion follows by proving a quantum Stein{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s lemma for this channel discrimination setting, showing that a constant bound on the Type I error leads to the Type II error decreasing to zero exponentially quickly at a rate determined by the maximum relative entropy registered between the channels. The strong converse part of the lemma states that any attempt to make the Type II error decay to zero at a rate faster than the channel relative entropy implies that the Type I error necessarily converges to one. We then refine this latter result by identifying the optimal strong converse exponent for this task. As a consequence of these results, we can establish a strong converse theorem for the quantum-feedback-assisted capacity of a channel, sharpening a result due to Bowen. Furthermore, our channel discrimination result demonstrates the asymptotic optimality of a non-adaptive tensor-power strategy in the setting of quantum illumination, as was used in prior work on the topic. The sandwiched R{\'{e}}nyi relative entropy is a key tool in our analysis.},

	Abstract = {Machine learning employs dynamical algorithms that mimic the human capacity to learn, where the reinforce-ment learning ones are among the most similar to humans in this respect. On the other hand, adaptability is an essential aspect to perform any task efficiently in a changing environment, and it is fundamental for many pur-poses, such as natural selection. Here, we propose an algorithm based on successive measurements to adapt one quantum state to a reference unknown state, in the sense of achieving maximum overlap. The protocol naturally provides many identical copies of the reference state, such that in each measurement iteration more information about it is obtained. In our protocol, we consider a system composed of three parts, the " environment " sys-tem, which provides the reference state copies; the register, which is an auxiliary subsystem that interacts with the environment to acquire information from it; and the agent, which corresponds to the quantum state that is adapted by digital feedback with input corresponding to the outcome of the measurements on the register. With this proposal we can achieve an average fidelity between the environment and the agent of more than 90{\%} with less than 30 iterations of the protocol. In addition, we extend the formalism to d-dimensional states, reaching an average fidelity of around 80{\%} in less than 400 iterations for d = 11, for a variety of genuinely quantum as well as semiclassical states. This work paves the way for the development of quantum reinforcement learning protocols using quantum data, and the future deployment of semi-autonomous quantum systems.},

However, exact realizations of quantum randomness take an extremely long time and are infeasible in many-body systems, leading to the notion of quantum pseudorandomness, also known as unitary designs. Here, to explore microscopic dynamics of generating quantum pseudorandomness in many-body systems, we provide new efficient constructions of unitary designs and propose a design Hamiltonian, a random Hamiltonian of which dynamics always forms a unitary design after a threshold time. The new constructions are based on the alternate applications of random potentials in the generalized position and momentum spaces, and we provide explicit quantum circuits generating quantum pseudorandomness significantly more efficient than previous ones. We then provide a design Hamiltonian in disordered systems with periodically changing spin-glass-type interactions. The design Hamiltonian generates quantum pseudorandomness in a constant time even in the system composed of a large number of spins. We also point out the close relationship between the design Hamiltonian and quantum chaos.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

In this paper, we consider bipartite state discrimination in a composite system consisting of {\$}N{\$} subsystems, where each subsystem is shared between two parties and the state of each subsystem is randomly sampled from a particular ensemble comprising the Bell states. We show that the success probability of perfectly identifying the state converges to {\$}1{\$} as {\$}N\backslashrightarrow\backslashinfty{\$} if the entropy of the probability distribution associated with the ensemble is less than {\$}1{\$}, even if the success probability is less than {\$}1{\$} for any finite {\$}N{\$}. In other words, the nonlocality of the {\$}N{\$}-fold ensemble asymptotically disappears if the probability distribution associated with each ensemble is concentrated. Furthermore, we show that the disappearance of the nonlocality can be regarded as a remarkable counterexample of a fundamental open question in theoretical computer science, called a parallel repetition conjecture of interactive games with two classically communicating players. Measurements for the discrimination task include a projective measurement of one party represented by stabilizer states, which enable the other party to perfectly distinguish states that are sampled with high probability.},

	Abstract = {The problem of discriminating the state of a quantum system among a number of hypothetical states is usually addressed under the assumption that one has perfect knowledge of the possible states of the system. In this thesis, I analyze the role of the prior information available in facing such problems, and consider scenarios where the information regarding the possible states is incomplete. In front of a complete ignorance of the possible states{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}} identity, I discuss a quantum "programmable" discrimination machine for qubit states that accepts this information as input programs using a quantum encoding, rather than as a classical description. The optimal performance of these machines is studied for general qubit states when several copies are provided, in the schemes of unambiguous, minimum-error, and error-margin discrimination. Then, this type of automation in discrimination tasks is taken further. By realizing a programmable machine as a device that is trained through quantum information to perform a specific task, I propose a quantum "learning" machine for classifying qubit states that does not require a quantum memory to store the qubit programs and, nevertheless, performs as good as quantum mechanics permits. Such learning machine thus allows for several optimal uses with no need for retraining. A similar learning scheme is also discussed for coherent states of light. I present it in the context of the readout of a classical memory by means of classically correlated coherent signals, when these are produced by an imperfect source. I show that, in this case, the retrieval of information stored in the memory can be carried out more accurately when fully general quantum measurements are used. Finally, as a transversal topic, I propose an efficient algorithmic way of decomposing any quantum measurement into convex combinations of simpler (extremal) measurements.},

This lends growing importance to latent variable models that try to learn the hidden information from the available imperfect versions. For example, social media platforms can contain an abundance of pictures of the same person, yet all of which are taken from different perspectives. In a simplified scenario, one may consider pictures taken from the same perspective, which are distorted by noise. This latter application allows for a rigorous mathematical treatment, which is the content of this contribution. We apply a recently developed method of dependent component analysis to image denoising when multiple distorted copies of one and the same image are available, each being corrupted by a different and unknown noise process. In a simplified scenario, one may assume such a distorted image to be corrupted by noise that acts independently on each pixel. We answer completely the question of how to perform optimal denoising, when at least three distorted copies are available: First we define optimality of an algorithm in the presented scenario, and then we describe an aymptotically optimal universal discrete denoising algorithm (UDDA).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

In this paper, we study the resource theory of coherence in a different light, that is, we consider the total coherence defined by the basis-free coherence maximized among all potential basis. We define the distillable total coherence and the total coherence cost and in both the asymptotic regime and the single-copy regime show the reversible transformation between a state with certain total coherence and the state with the unit reference total coherence. Extensively, we demonstrate that the total coherence can also be completely converted to the total correlation with the equal amount by the free operations.

	Abstract = {Quantum state discrimination is a fundamental primitive in quantum statistics where one has to correctly identify the state of a system that is in one of two possible known states. A programmable discrimination machine performs this task when the pair of possible states is not a priori known but instead the two possible states are provided through two respective program ports. We study optimal programmable discrimination machines for general qubit states when several copies of states are available in the data or program ports. Two scenarios are considered: One in which the purity of the possible states is a priori known, and the fully universal one where the machine operates over generic mixed states of unknown purity. We find analytical results for both the unambiguous and minimum error discrimination strategies. This allows us to calculate the asymptotic performance of programmable discrimination machines when a large number of copies are provided and to recover the standard state discrimination and state comparison values as different limiting cases.},

It describes the transition between previous approximate models for the weak and the ultrastrong coupling limit, and it predicts optimal refrigeration for moderately strong coupling, where both approximations are inaccurate. Two effects impede a more effective cooling: the coupling between the spins no longer reduces to a simple resonant energy exchange (the rotating wave approximation fails), and the interactions with the thermal baths become sensitive to the level splitting, thus opening additional heat channels between the reservoirs. We identify the modified conditions of refrigeration as a function of the inter-spin coupling strength, and we show that, contrary to intuition, a high-temperature work reservoir thwarts refrigeration in the strong coupling regime.},

We further prove rigorously that for this class of disorder the fractal dimension of the ground state d* tends to the physical dimension in the thermodynamic limit. This allows us to introduce a quantity, the fractional occupation, which gives insightful information on the crossover from a Lifshits to a Bose glass. Finally, we compare temperature and interaction effects, highlighting similarities and intrinsic differences.},

@article{Bryan2018,
	Abstract = {The 'problem of time' remains an unresolved issue in all known physical descriptions of the Universe. One aspect of this problem is the conspicuous absence of time in the Wheeler-Dewitt equation, which is the analogue of the Schrodinger equation for the Universal wavefunction. Page and Wootters famously addressed this problem by providing a mechanism for effectively introducing time evolution. Their method, which is sometimes called the conditional probability interpretation (CPI), requires the identification of an internal clock system that is meant to keep time for the remainder of the Universe. Most investigations into this idea employ the idealized limit of a non-interacting clock system, the so-called ideal clock. However, by allowing for interactions, we have found the counter-intuitive result that a non-interacting clock is not necessarily the optimal choice, even if it is 'ideal'. In particular, the uncertainty that is associated with the physical measurement of an atomic clock is found to decrease monotonically as the interactions grow stronger. This observation, which is reinforced by a previous study using a semi-classical clock, paves the way to an independent argument that is based on the energy conservation of any isolated system. Our conclusion is that ideal clocks must be prohibited from the CPI, as interactions are necessary for describing time evolution as a strict matter of principle.},

	Abstract = {We consider two entanglement-assisted communication problems in which multiple parties have access to one-way classical noisy channels. We focus on the zero-error regime, where the problems can be studied in graph theoretical terms. The first problem we study is the compound channel, where one sender needs to communicate one message to multiple receivers. We show that the entanglement-assisted capacity of a compound channel converges to the classical one as the number of receivers goes to infinity. We give an upper bound on the number of receivers needed for the convergence, related to the number of channel outputs. On the other hand, we exhibit a class of channels for which entanglement gives an advantage over the classical setting if the number of receivers is fixed. The second problem we consider features multiple collaborating senders and one receiver. Classically, cooperation between the senders might allow them to communicate on average more bits than the sum of their individual capacities. We show that whenever a channel allows single-sender entanglement-assisted advantage, then the advantage extends also to the multi-sender case. Furthermore, we show that a classical equality regarding a fixed number of uses of a channel with multiple senders is violated in the entanglement-assisted setting.},

	Abstract = {Correlations in general and entanglement in particular are indispensable resources for numerous quantum information tasks. However, their establishment comes at the cost of energy and is limited by the initial entropy. Here we establish general bounds on the generation of correlations of two arbitrary systems in the presence of a thermal bath, and construct a protocol saturating them. The amount of correlations, quantified by the mutual information, can increase at most linearly with the available energy, and we determine where the linear regime breaks down. We further consider the generation of genuine quantum correlations, focusing on the fundamental constituents of our universe: fermions and bosons. For fermionic modes we find the optimal entangling protocol. For bosonic modes we show that, while Gaussian operations can be outperformed in creating entanglement, their performance is optimal for high available energy.},

	Abstract = {Manipulation and quantification of quantum resources are fundamental problems in quantum physics. In the asymptotic limit, coherence distillation and dilution have been proposed by manipulating infinite identical copies of states. In the nonasymptotic setting, finite data-size effects emerge, and the practically relevant problem of coherence manipulation using finite resources has been left open. This Letter establishes the one-shot theory of coherence dilution, which involves converting maximally coherent states into an arbitrary quantum state using maximally incoherent operations, dephasing-covariant incoherent operations, incoherent operations, or strictly incoherent operations. We introduce several coherence monotones with concrete operational interpretations that estimate the one-shot coherence cost---the minimum amount of maximally coherent states needed for faithful coherence dilution. Furthermore, we derive the asymptotic coherence dilution results with maximally incoherent operations, incoherent operations, and strictly incoherent operations as special cases. Our result can be applied in the analyses of quantum information processing tasks that exploit coherence as resources, such as quantum key distribution and random number generation.},

	Abstract = {This thesis deals with the study of quantum communication protocols with Continuous Variable (CV) systems. CV systems are those described by canonical conjugated coordinates {\$}x{\$} and {\$}p{\$} endowed with infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, thus involving a complex mathematical structure. A special class of CV states, are the so-called Gaussian states. We present a protocol that permits to extract quantum keys from entangled Gaussian states. Differently from discrete systems, Gaussian entangled states cannot be distilled with Gaussian operations only. However it was already shown, that it is still possible to extract perfectly correlated classical bits to establish secret random keys. We properly modify the protocol using bipartite Gaussian entanglement to perform quantum key distribution in an efficient and realistic way. We describe and demonstrate security in front of different possible attacks on the communication, detailing the resources demanded. We also consider a simple 3-partite protocol known as Byzantine Agreement. It is an old classical communication problem in which parties (with possible traitors among them) can only communicate pairwise, while trying to reach a common decision. Classically, there is a bound in the maximal number of possible traitors that can be involved in the game. Nevertheless, a quantum solution exist. We show that solution within CV using multipartite entangled Gaussian states and Gaussian operations. Furthermore, we show under which premises concerning entanglement content of the state, noise, inefficient homodyne detectors, our protocol is efficient and applicable with present technology.

It is known that in spite of their exceptional role within the space of all CV states, in fact, Gaussian states are not always the best candidates to perform quantum information tasks. Thus, we tackle the problem of quantification of correlations (quantum and/or classical) between two CV modes (Gaussian and non-Gaussian). We propose to define correlations between the two modes as the maximal number of correlated bits extracted via local quadrature measurements on each mode. On Gaussian states, where entanglement is accessible via their covariance matrix our quantification majorizes entanglement, reducing to an entanglement monotone for pure states. For non-Gaussian states, such as photonic Bell states, photon subtracted states and mixtures of Gaussian states, the bit quadrature correlations are shown to be also a monotonic function of the negativity. This quantification yields a feasible, operational way to measure non-Gaussian entanglement in current experiments by means of direct homodyne detection, without needing a complete state tomography with the same complexity as if dealing with Gaussian states.

Finally we focus to atomic ensembles described as CV. Measurement induced entanglement between two macroscopical atomic samples was reported experimentally in 2001. There, the interaction between a single laser pulse propagating through two spatially separated atomic samples combined with a final projective measurement on the light led to the creation of pure EPR entanglement between the two samples. We show how to generate, manipulate and detect mesoscopic entanglement between an arbitrary number of atomic samples through a quantum non-demolition matter-light interface. Our proposal extends in a non-trivial way for multipartite entanglement (GHZ and cluster-like) without needing local magnetic fields. Moreover, we show quite surprisingly that given the irreversible character of a measurement, the interaction of the atomic sample with a second pulse light can modify and even reverse the entangling action of the first one leaving the samples in a separable state.},

Here we generalize thermodynamics to physical scenarios which allow presence of correlations, including those where strong correlations are present. We exploit the connection between information and physics, and introduce a consistent redefinition of heat dissipation by systematically accounting for the information flow from system to bath in terms of the conditional entropy. As a consequence, the formula for the Helmholtz free energy is accordingly modified. Such a remedy not only fixes the apparent violations of Landauer{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s erasure principle and the second law due to anomalous heat flows, but also leads to a generally valid reformulation of the laws of thermodynamics. In this information-theoretic approach, correlations between system and environment store work potential. Thus, in this view, the apparent anomalous heat flows are the refrigeration processes driven by such potentials.},

	Abstract = {In this work we formulate thermodynamics as an exclusive consequence of information conservation. The framework can be applied to most general situations, beyond the traditional assumptions in thermodynamics, where systems and thermal-baths could be quantum, of arbitrary sizes and even could posses inter-system correlations. Further, it does not require a priori predetermined temperature associated to a thermal-bath, which does not carry much sense for finite-size cases. Importantly, the thermal-baths and systems are not treated here differently, rather both are considered on equal footing. This leads us to introduce a "temperature"-independent formulation of thermodynamics. We rely on the fact that, for a given amount of information, measured by the von Neumann entropy, any system can be transformed to a state that possesses minimal energy. This state is known as a completely passive state that acquires a Boltzmann--Gibb's canonical form with an intrinsic temperature. We introduce the notions of bound and free energy and use them to quantify heat and work respectively. We explicitly use the information conservation as the fundamental principle of nature, and develop universal notions of equilibrium, heat and work, universal fundamental laws of thermodynamics, and Landauer's principle that connects thermodynamics and information. We demonstrate that the maximum efficiency of a quantum engine with a finite bath is in general different and smaller than that of an ideal Carnot's engine. We introduce a resource theoretic framework for our intrinsic-temperature based thermodynamics, within which we address the problem of work extraction and inter-state transformations. We also extend the framework to the cases of multiple conserved quantities.},

	Abstract = {We show that the new quantum extension of Renyi{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s $\alpha$-relative entropies, introduced recently by Muller-Lennert, Dupuis, Szehr, Fehr and Tomamichel, J. Math. Phys. 54, 122203, (2013), and Wilde, Winter, Yang, Commun. Math. Phys. 331, (2014), have an operational interpretation in the strong converse problem of quantum hypothesis testing. Together with related results for the direct part of quantum hypothesis testing, known as the quantum Hoeffding bound, our result suggests that the operationally relevant definition of the quantum Renyi relative entropies depends on the parameter $\alpha$: for $\alpha${\textless}1, the right choice seems to be the traditional definition, whereas for $\alpha${\textgreater}1 the right choice is the newly introduced version.
As a sideresult, we show that the new Renyi $\alpha$-relative entropies are asymptotically attainable by measurements for $\alpha${\textgreater}1, and give a new simple proof for their monotonicity under completely positive trace-preserving maps.},

	Abstract = {We discuss the following variant of the standard minimum error state discrimination problem: Alice picks the state she sends to Bob among one of several disjoint state ensembles, and she communicates him the chosen ensemble only at a later time. Two different scenarios then arise: either Bob is allowed to arrange his measurement set-up after Alice has announced him the chosen ensemble, or he is forced to perform the measurement before of Alice's announcement. In the latter case, he can only post-process his measurement outcome when Alice's extra information becomes available. We compare the optimal guessing probabilities in the two scenarios, and we prove that they are the same if and only if there exist compatible optimal measurements for all of Alice's state ensembles. When this is the case, post-processing any of the corresponding joint measurements is Bob's optimal strategy in the post-measurement information scenario. Furthermore, we establish a connection between discrimination with post-measurement information and the standard state discrimination. By means of this connection and exploiting the presence of symmetries, we are able to compute the various guessing probabilities in many concrete examples.},

	Abstract = {It is known that arrays of trapped ions can be used to efficiently simulate a variety of many-body quantum systems. Here we show how it is possible to build a model representing a spin chain interacting with bosons that is exactly solvable. The exact spectrum of the model at zero temperature and the ground-state properties are studied. We show that a quantum phase transition occurs when the coupling between spins and bosons reaches a critical value, which corresponds to a level crossing in the energy spectrum. Once the critical point is reached, the number of bosonic excitations in the ground state, which can be assumed as an order parameter, starts to be different from zero. The population of the bosonic mode is accompanied by a macroscopic magnetization of the spins. This double effect could represent a useful resource for phase transition detection since a measure of the phonon can give information about the phase of the spin system. A finite-temperature phase diagram is also given in the adiabatic regime.},

	Abstract = {Randomness is a defining element of mixing processes in nature and an essential ingredient to many protocols in quantum information. In this work, we investigate how much randomness is required to transform a given quantum state into another one. Specifically, we ask whether there is a gap between the power of a classical source of randomness compared to that of a quantum one. We provide a complete answer to these questions, by identifying provably optimal protocols for both classical and quantum sources of randomness, based on a dephasing construction. We find that in order to implement any noisy transition on a d-dimensional quantum system it is necessary and sufficient to have a quantum source of randomness of dimension √ d or a classical one of dimension d. Interestingly, coherences provided by quantum states in a source of randomness offer a quadratic advantage. The process we construct has the additional features to be robust and catalytic, i.e., the source of randomness can be re-used. Building upon this formal framework, we illustrate that this dephasing construction can serve as a useful primitive in both equilibration and quantum information theory: We discuss applications describing the smallest measurement device, capturing the smallest equilibrating environment allowed by quan-tum mechanics, or forming the basis for a cryptographic private quantum channel. We complement the exact analysis with a discussion of approximate protocols based on quantum expanders deriving from discrete Weyl systems. This gives rise to equilibrating environments of remarkably small dimension. Our results highlight the curious feature of randomness that residual correlations and dimension can be traded against each other.},

	Abstract = {We study the zero-temperature phase diagram of the disordered spin-1 Bose-Hubbard model in a two-dimensional square lattice. To this aim, we use a mean-field Gutzwiller ansatz and a probabilistic mean-field perturbation theory. The spin interaction induces two different regimes, corresponding to a ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order. In the ferromagnetic case, the introduction of disorder reproduces analogous features of the disordered scalar Bose-Hubbard model, consisting in the formation of a Bose glass phase between Mott insulator lobes. In the antiferromagnetic regime, the phase diagram differs more from the scalar case. Disorder in the chemical potential can lead to the disappearance of Mott insulator lobes with an odd-integer filling factor and, for sufficiently strong spin coupling, to Bose glass of singlets between even-filling Mott insulator lobes. Disorder in the spinor coupling parameter results in the appearance of a Bose glass phase only between the n and the n+1 lobes for n odd. Disorder in the scalar Hubbard interaction inhibits Mott insulator regions for occupation larger than a critical value.},

@article{Giacomini2017,
	Abstract = {In physics, every observation is made with respect to a frame of reference. Although reference frames are usually not considered as degrees of freedom, in all practical situations it is a physical system which constitutes a reference frame. Can a quantum system be considered as a reference frame and, if so, which description would it give of the world? The relational approach to physics suggests that all the features of a system -such as entanglement and superposition- are observer-dependent: what appears classical from our usual laboratory description might appear to be in a superposition, or entangled, from the point of view of such a quantum reference frame. In this work, we develop an operational framework for quantum theory to be applied within quantum reference frames. We find that, when reference frames are treated as quantum degrees of freedom, a more general transformation between reference frames has to be introduced. With this transformation we describe states, measurement, and dynamical evolution in different quantum reference frames, without appealing to an external, absolute reference frame. The transformation also leads to a generalisation of the notion of covariance of dynamical physical laws, which we explore in the case of `superposition of Galilean translations' and `superposition of Galilean boosts'. In addition, we consider the situation when the reference frame moves in a `superposition of accelerations', which leads us to extend the validity of the weak equivalence principle to quantum reference frames. Finally, this approach to quantum reference frames also has natural applications in defining the notion of the rest frame of a quantum system when it is in a superposition of momenta with respect to the laboratory frame of reference.},

@article{303,
	Abstract = {We study entanglement distribution in quantum complex networks where nodes are connected by bipartite entangled states. These networks are characterized by a complex structure, which dramatically affects how information is transmitted through them. For pure quantum state links, quantum networks exhibit a remarkable feature absent in classical networks: it is possible to effectively rewire the network by performing local operations on the nodes. We propose a family of such quantum operations that decrease the entanglement percolation threshold of the network and increase the size of the giant connected component. We provide analytic results for complex networks with an arbitrary (uncorrelated) degree distribution. These results are in good agreement with numerical simulations, which also show enhancement in correlated and real-world networks. The proposed quantum preprocessing strategies are not robust in the presence of noise. However, even when the links consist of (noisy) mixed-state links, one can send quantum information through a connecting path with a fidelity that decreases with the path length. In this noisy scenario, complex networks offer a clear advantage over regular lattices, namely, the fact that two arbitrary nodes can be connected through a relatively small number of steps, known as the small-world effect. We calculate the probability that two arbitrary nodes in the network can successfully communicate with a fidelity above a given threshold. This amounts to working out the classical problem of percolation with a limited path length. We find that this probability can be significant even for paths limited to few connections and that the results for standard (unlimited) percolation are soon recovered if the path length exceeds by a finite amount the average path length, which in complex networks generally scales logarithmically with the size of the network.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a 3-parameter class of maps (1) acting on a bipartite system which are a natural generalisation of the depolarizing channel (and include it as a special case). Then, we find the exact regions of the parameter space that alternatively determine a positive, completely positive, entanglement-breaking, or entanglement-annihilating map. This model displays a much richer behaviour than the one shown by a simple depolarizing channel, yet it stays exactly solvable. As an example of this richness, positive partial transposition but not entanglement-breaking maps is found in Theorem 2. A simple example of a positive yet indecomposable map is provided (see the Remark at the end of Section IV). The study of the entanglement-annihilating property is fully addressed by Theorem 7. Finally, we apply our results to solve the problem of the entanglement annihilation caused in a bipartite system by a tensor product of local depolarizing channels. In this context, a conjecture posed in the work of Filippov [J. Russ. Laser Res. 35, 484 (2014)] is affirmatively answered, and the gaps that the imperfect bounds of Filippov and Ziman [Phys. Rev.

In this paper we explore some theoretical foundations of this link and show how it opens up a new avenue for the design of quantum machine learning algorithms. We interpret the process of encoding inputs in a quantum state as a nonlinear feature map that maps data to quantum Hilbert space. A quantum computer can now analyse the input data in this feature space. Based on this link, we discuss two approaches for building a quantum model for classification. In the first approach, the quantum device estimates inner products of quantum states to compute a classically intractable kernel. This kernel can be fed into any classical kernel method such as a support vector machine. In the second approach, we can use a variational quantum circuit as a linear model that classifies data explicitly in Hilbert space. We illustrate these ideas with a feature map based on squeezing in a continuous-variable system, and visualise the working principle with 2-dimensional mini-benchmark datasets.},

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}An open question of fundamental importance in thermodynamics is howto describe the fluctuations of work for quantum coherent processes. In the standard approach, based on a projective energy measurement both at the beginning and at the end of the process, the first measurement destroys any initial coherence in the energy basis. Here we seek extensions of this approach which can possibly account for initially coherent states. We consider all measurement schemes to estimate work and require that (i) the difference of average energy corresponds to average work for closed quantum systems and that (ii) the work statistics agree with the standard two-measurement scheme for states with no coherence in the energy basis. We first show that such a scheme cannot exist. Next, we consider the possibility of performing collective measurements on several copies of the state and prove that it is still impossible to simultaneously satisfy requirements (i) and (ii). Nevertheless, improvements do appear, and in particular, we develop a measurement scheme that acts simultaneously on two copies of the state and allows us to describe a whole class of coherent transformations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

We first show that this capacity is only a function of the linear span of Choi-Kraus operators of the channel, which generalizes the bipartite equivocation graph of a classical channel, and which we dub non-commutative bipartite graph. Then, we go on to show that the feedback-assisted capacity is non-zero (allowing for a constant amount of activating noiseless communication) if and only if the non-commutative bipartite graph is non-trivial, and give a number of equivalent characterizations. This result involves a far-reaching extension of the conclusive exclusion of quantum states. We then present an upper bound on the feedback-assisted zero-error capacity, motivated by a conjecture originally made by Shannon and proved later by Ahlswede. We demonstrate that this bound to have many good properties, including being additive and given by a minimax formula. We also prove a coding theorem showing that this quantity is the entanglement-assisted capacity against an adversarially chosen channel from the set of all channels with the same Choi-Kraus span, which can also be interpreted as the feedback-assisted unambiguous capacity. The proof relies on a generalization of the Postselection Lemma (de Finetti reduction) that allows to reflect additional constraints, and which we believe to be of independent interest. This capacity is a relaxation of the feedback-assisted zero-error capacity; however, we have to leave open the question of whether they coincide in general. We illustrate our ideas with a number of examples, including classical-quantum channels and Weyl diagonal channels, and close with an extensive discussion of open questions.},

	Abstract = {Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, such as Q-learning, directly parameterize and update value functions or policies without explicitly modeling the environment. They are typically simpler, more flexible to use, and thus more prevalent in modern deep RL than model-based approaches. However, empirical work has suggested that model-free algorithms may require more samples to learn [7, 22]. The theoretical question of ``whether model-free algorithms can be made sample efficient'' is one of the most fundamental questions in RL, and remains unsolved even in the basic scenario with finitely many states and actions. We prove that, in an episodic MDP setting, Q-learning with UCB exploration achieves regret {\~{O}}(H 3 SAT), where S and A are the numbers of states and actions, H is the number of steps per episode, and T is the total number of steps. This sample efficiency matches the optimal regret that can be achieved by any model-based approach, up to a single H factor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis in the model-free setting that establishes T regret without requiring access to a ``simulator.''},

	Abstract = {We numerically study the performance of the displacement based quantum receiver for the discrimination of weak 3- and 4-phase-shift keyed (PSK) coherent state signals. We show that due to the nontrivial asymmetry of the receiver structure, optimization of the prior probability increases the mutual information and achieves sub-shot-noise limit discrimination. Moreover, we estimate the cutoff rate for a 4-PSK signal and confirm that the prior probability optimization shortens the code length for a given decoding error criterion.

	Abstract = {We study zero-error entanglement-assisted source-channel coding (communication in the presence of side information). Adapting a technique of Beigi, we show that such coding requires existence of a set of vectors satisfying orthogonality conditions related to suitably defined graphs G and H. Such vectors exist if and only if ϑ(G̅) ≤ ϑ(H̅), where ϑ represents the Lov{\'a}sz number. We also obtain similar inequalities for the related Schrijver ϑ- and Szegedy ϑ+ numbers. These inequalities reproduce several known bounds and also lead to new results. We provide a lower bound on the entanglement-assisted cost rate. We show that the entanglement-assisted independence number is bounded by the Schrijver number: $\alpha$*(G) ≤ ϑ-(G). Therefore, we are able to disprove the conjecture that the one-shot entanglement-assisted zero-error capacity is equal to the integer part of the Lov{\'a}sz number. Beigi introduced a quantity $\beta$ as an upper bound on $\alpha$* and posed the question of whether $\beta$(G) = ⌊ϑ(G)⌋. We answer this in the affirmative and show that a related quantity is equal to ⌊ϑ(G)⌋. We show that a quantity $\chi$vect(G) recently introduced in the context of Tsirelson's problem is equal to ⌊ϑ+(G)⌋. In an appendix, we investigate multiplicativity properties of Schrijver's and Szegedy's numbers, as well as projective rank.},

	Abstract = {We study the problem of designing optical receivers to discriminate between multiple coherent states using coherent processing receivers---i.e., one that uses arbitrary coherent feedback control and quantum-noise-limited direct detection---which was shown by Dolinar to achieve the minimum error probability in discriminating any two coherent states. We first derive and re-interpret Dolinar's binary-hypothesis minimum-probability-of-error receiver as the one that optimizes the information efficiency at each time instant, based on recursive Bayesian updates within the receiver. Using this viewpoint, we propose a natural generalization of Dolinar's receiver design to discriminate {\$}M{\$} coherent states each of which could now be a codeword, i.e., a sequence of {\$}N{\$} coherent states each drawn from a modulation alphabet. We analyze the channel capacity of the pure-loss optical channel with a general coherent-processing receiver in the low-photon number regime and compare it with the capacity achievable with direct detection and the Holevo limit (achieving the latter would require a quantum joint-detection receiver). We show compelling evidence that despite the optimal performance of Dolinar's receiver for the binary coherent-state hypothesis test (either in error probability or mutual information), the asymptotic communication rate achievable by such a coherent-processing receiver is only as good as direct detection. This suggests that in the infinitely-long codeword limit, all potential benefits of coherent processing at the receiver can be obtained by designing a good code and direct detection, with no feedback within the receiver.},

From the Hamiltonian other equivalent representations of the Gaussian unitaries are obtained, such as Bogoliubov and real symplectic transformations. The paper develops an alternative representation, called complex symplectic transformation, which is more compact and is comprehensive of both Bogoliubov and real symplectic transformations. Moreover, it has other advantages. One of the main results of the theory, not available in the literature, is that the final displacement is not simply given by the linear part of the Hamiltonian, but depends also on the quadratic part. In particular, it is shown that by combining squeezing and rotation, it is possible to achieve a final displacement with an arbitrary amount.},

	Abstract = {Coherent states of light, and methods for distinguishing between them, are central to all applications of laser light. We obtain the ultimate quantum limit on the error probability exponent for discriminating among any M multimode coherent-state waveforms via the quantum Chernoff exponent in M-ary multi-copy state discrimination. A receiver, i.e., a concrete realization of a quantum measurement, called the Sequential Waveform Nulling (SWN) receiver, is proposed for discriminating an arbitrary coherent-state ensemble using only auxiliary coherent-state fields, beam splitters, and non-number-resolving single photon detectors. An explicit error probability analysis of the SWN receiver is used to show that it achieves the quantum limit on the error probability exponent, which is shown to be a factor of four greater than the error probability exponent of an ideal heterodyne-detection receiver on the same ensemble. We generalize the philosophy of the SWN receiver, which is itself adapted from some existing coherent-state receivers, and propose a receiver -- the Sequential Testing (ST) receiver-- for discriminating n copies of M pure quantum states from an arbitrary Hilbert space. The ST receiver is shown to achieve the quantum Chernoff exponent in the limit of a large number of copies, and is remarkable in requiring only local operations and classical communication (LOCC) to do so. In particular, it performs adaptive copy-by-copy binary projective measurements. Apart from being of fundamental interest, these results are relevant to communication, sensing, and imaging systems that use laser light and to photonic implementations of quantum information processing protocols in general.},

We also consider quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signals and phase-shift keying signals with dyne-type detections. We show the quantitative gap between these detection strategies in terms of the capacity, particularly in the quantum-limited region where the quantum noise seriously limits the transmission rate. In particular, we find that for an extremely weak signal input power, use of a multilevel PPM system is a good strategy, whereas for an extremely strong signal, use of a multilevel QAM system is recommended.},

	Abstract = {Hypothesis testing is a fundamental issue in statistical inference and has been a crucial element in the development of information sciences. The Chernoff bound gives the minimal Bayesian error probability when discriminating two hypotheses given a large number of observations. Recently the combined work of Audenaert et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 160501] and Nussbaum and Szkola   [quant-ph/0607216] has proved the quantum analog of this bound, which applies when the hypotheses correspond to two quantum states. Based on the quantum Chernoff bound, we define a physically meaningful distinguishability measure and its corresponding metric in the space of states; the latter is shown to coincide with the Wigner-Yanase metric. Along the same lines, we define a second, more easily implementable, distinguishability measure based on the error probability of discrimination when the same local measurement is performed on every copy. We study some general properties of these measures, including the probability distribution of density matrices, defined via the volume element induced by the metric, and illustrate their use in the paradigmatic cases of qubits and Gaussian infinite-dimensional states.},

In the following we review alternative mechanisms, notably the use of more general quantum correlations such as quantum discord, identical particles, or non-trivial hamiltonians; the estimation of thermodynamical parameters or parameters characterizing non-equilibrium states; and the use of quantum phase transitions. We describe both theoretically achievable enhancements and enhanced sensitivities, not primarily based on entanglement, that have already been demonstrated experimentally, and indicate some possible future research directions.},

A notion of an effective decision Hilbert space is introduced and necessary and sufficient condkions for optimality of multiple quantum hypothesis testing in this space are formulated. The general solution is found for the case of a two-dimensional decision space. Another problem solved is that of discrimination of quantum pure non-orthogonal states. The result is represented in explicit analytical form for an "equidiagonal" case, which is quite general. In particular, we find explicit solutions of optimal discrimination problem of homogeneous and equiangle sets of pure states. These results are used for the M-ary detection problem in solving for the quantum coherent non-orthogonal signals. It is proved that the simplex signals are optimal elso in quantum case.

@article{Lund2017,
	Abstract = {There is a large body of evidence for the potential of greater computational power using information carriers that are quantum mechanical over those governed by the laws of classical mechanics. But the question of the exact nature of the power contributed by quantum mechanics remains only partially answered. Furthermore, there exists doubt over the practicality of achieving a large enough quantum computation that definitively demonstrates quantum supremacy. Recently the study of computational problems that produce samples from probability distributions has added to both our understanding of the power of quantum algorithms and lowered the requirements for demonstration of fast quantum algorithms. The proposed quantum sampling problems do not require a quantum computer capable of universal operations and also permit physically realistic errors in their operation. This is an encouraging step towards an experimental demonstration of quantum algorithmic supremacy. In this paper, we will review sampling problems and the arguments that have been used to deduce when sampling problems are hard for classical computers to simulate. Two classes of quantum sampling problems that demonstrate the supremacy of quantum algorithms are BosonSampling and IQP Sampling. We will present the details of these classes and recent experimental progress towards demonstrating quantum supremacy in BosonSampling.},

	Abstract = {Gathering data through measurements is at the basis of every experimental science. Ideally, measurements should be repeatable and, when extracting only coarse-grained data, they should allow the experimenter to retrieve the finer details at a later time. However, in practice most measurements appear to be noisy. Here we postulate that, despite the imperfections observed in real life experiments, there exists a fundamental level where all measurements are ideal. Combined with the requirement that ideal measurements remain so when coarse-grained or applied in parallel on spacelike separated systems, our postulate places a powerful constraint on the amount of nonlocality and contextuality that can be found in an arbitrary physical theory, bringing down the violation of Bell and Kocher-Specker inequalities near to its quantum value. In addition, it provides a new compelling motivation for the principles of Local Orthogonality and Consistent Exclusivity, recently proposed for the characterization of the quantum set of probability distributions.},

	Abstract = {A major signature of quantum mechanics beyond classical physics is coherence, the existence of superposition states. The recently developed resource theory of quantum coherence allows the formalisation of incoherent operations -- those operations which cannot create coherence. We identify the set of operations which additionally do not use coherence. These are such that coherence cannot be exploited by a classical observer, who measures incoherent properties of the system, to go beyond classical dynamics. We give a physical interpretation in terms of interferometry and prove a dilation theorem, showing how these operations can always be constructed by interacting the system in an incoherent way with an ancilla. Such a physical justification is not known for the incoherent operations, thus our results lead to a physically well-motivated resource theory of coherence. Next, we investigate the implications for coherence in multipartite systems. We show that quantum correlations can be defined naturally with respect to a fixed basis, providing a link between coherence and quantum discord. We demonstrate the interplay between these two quantities under our studied operations, and suggest implications for the theory of quantum discord by relating the studied operations to those which cannot create discord.},

	Abstract = {We discuss a novel implementation of the minimum error state discrimination measurement, originally introduced by Helstrom. In this implementation, instead of performing the optimal projective measurement directly on the system, it is first entangled to an ancillary system and the measurement is performed on the ancilla. We show that, by an appropriate choice of the entanglement transformation, the Helstrom bound can be attained. The advantage of this approach is twofold. First, it provides a novel implementation when the optimal projective measurement cannot be directly performed. For example, in the case of continuous variable states (binary and N phase-shifted coherent signals), the available detection methods, photon counting and homodyning, are insufficient to perform the required cat-state projection. In the case of symmetric states, the square-root measurement is optimal, but it is not easy to perform directly for more than two states. Our approach provides a feasible alternative in both cases. Second, the measurement is non-destructive from the point of view of the original system and one has a certain amount of freedom in designing the post-measurement state, which can then be processed further.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we consider the minimal entropy of qubit states transmitted through two uses of a noisy quantum channel, which is modeled by the action of a completely positive trace-preserving (or stochastic) map. We provide strong support for the conjecture that this minimal entropy is additive, namely that the minimum entropy can be achieved when product states are transmitted. Explicitly, we prove that for a tensor product of two unital stochastic maps on qubit states, using an entanglement that involves only states which emerge with minimal entropy cannot decrease the entropy below the minimum achievable using product states. We give a separate argument, based on the geometry of the image of the set of density matrices under stochastic maps, which suggests that the minimal entropy conjecture holds for non-unital as well as for unital maps. We also show that the maximal norm of the output states is multiplicative for most product maps on {\$}n{\$}-qubit states, including all those for which at least one map is unital. For the class of {\{}$\backslash$it unital{\}} channels on {\$}{\{}\backslashbf C{\}}{\^{}}2{\$}, we show that additivity of minimal entropy implies that the Holevo capacity of the channel is {\{}$\backslash$it additive{\}} over two inputs, achievable with orthogonal states, and equal to the Shannon capacity. This implies that superadditivity of the capacity is possible only for non-unital channels.},

	Abstract = {Can quantum mechanics help us in building intelligent robots and agents? One of the defining characteristics of intelligent behavior is the capacity to learn from experience. However, a major bottleneck for agents to learn in any real-life situation is the size and complexity of the corresponding task environment. Owing to, e.g., a large space of possible strategies, learning is typically slow. Even for a moderate task environment, it may simply take too long to rationally respond to a given situation. If the environment is impatient, allowing only a certain time for a response, an agent may then be unable to cope with the situation and to learn at all. Here we show that quantum physics can help and provide a significant speed-up for active learning as a genuine problem of artificial intelligence. We introduce a large class of quantum learning agents for which we show a quadratic boost in their active learning efficiency over their classical analogues. This result will be particularly relevant for applications involving complex task environments.},

@article{Jarzyna2017,
	Abstract = {In most communication scenarios, sending a symbol encoded in a quantum state requires spending resources such as energy, which can be quantified by a cost of communication. A standard approach in this context is to quantify the performance of communication protocol by classical capacity, quantifying the maximal amount of information that can be transmitted through a quantum channel per single use of the channel. However, different figures of merit are also possible, and a particularly well-suited one is the classical capacity per unit cost, which quantifies the maximal amount of information that can be transmitted per unit cost. I generalize this concept to account for the quantum nature of the information carriers and communication channels and show that if there exist a symbol with cost equal to zero, e.g. a vacuum state, the capacity per unit cost can be expressed by a simple formula containing maximization of the relative entropy between two quantum states. This enables me to analyze the behavior of photon information efficiency for general communication tasks and show simple bounds on the capacity per unit cost in terms of quantities familiar from quantum estimation theory. I calculate also the capacity per unit cost for general Gaussian quantum channels.},

The second region consists of the rates at which each sender can send quantum information. For each region, we give an example of a channel for which the corresponding region has a single-letter description. One of our examples relies on a new result proved here, perhaps of independent interest, stating that the coherent information over any degradable channel is concave in the input density operator.

As a result, the obtained PDT varies from log-negative Weibull to truncated log-normal distributions depending on the channel characteristics. Moreover, we show that the method allows one to consistently describe beam tracking, a procedure which is typically used in practical long-distance free-space quantum communication.

The problem consists in finding the learning machine that optimally emulates the examples, thus reproducing the unknown unitary maximum fidelity. Learning a unitary is equivalent to storing it in the state of a quantum memory (the memory of the learning machine), and subsequently retrieving it. We prove that, whenever the unknown unitary is drawn from a group, the optimal strategy consists in a parallel call of the available uses followed by a "measure-and-rotate" retrieving. Differing from the case of quantum cloning, where the incoherent "measure-and-prepare" strategies are typically suboptimal, in the case of learning the "measure-and-rotate" strategy is optimal even when the learning machine is asked to reproduce a single copy of the unknown unitary. We finally address the problem of the optimal inversion of an unknown unitary evolution, showing also in this case the optimality of the "measure-and-rotate" strategies and applying our result to the optimal approximate realignment of reference frames for quantum communication.},

	Abstract = {The design and analysis of communication systems typically rely on the development of mathematical models that describe the underlying communication channel, which dictates the relationship between the transmitted and the received signals. However, in some systems, such as molecular communication systems where chemical signals are used for transfer of information, it is not possible to accurately model this relationship. In these scenarios, because of the lack of mathematical channel models, a completely new approach to design and analysis is required. In this work, we focus on one important aspect of communication systems, the detection algorithms, and demonstrate that by borrowing tools from deep learning, it is possible to train detectors that perform well, without any knowledge of the underlying channel models. We evaluate these algorithms using experimental data that is collected by a chemical communication platform, where the channel model is unknown and difficult to model analytically. We show that deep learning algorithms perform significantly better than a simple detector that was used in previous works, which also did not assume any knowledge of the channel.},

	Abstract = {Nonclassical states are essential for optics-based quantum information processing, but their fragility limits their utility for practical scenarios in which loss and noise inevitably degrade, if not destroy, nonclassicality. Exploiting nonclassical states in quantum metrology yields sensitivity advantages over all classical schemes delivering the same energy per measurement interval to the sample being probed. These enhancements, almost without exception, are severely diminished by quantum decoherence. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an entanglement-enhanced sensing system that is resilient to quantum decoherence. We employ entanglement to realize a 20{\%} signal-to-noise ratio improvement over the optimum classical scheme in an entanglement-breaking environment plagued by 14 dB of loss and a noise background 75 dB stronger than the returned probe light. Our result suggests that advantageous quantum-sensing technology could be developed for practical situations.},

Recently, duality relations in which the wave-like properties are quantified by using measures of quantum coherence have been proposed. Quantum coherence can be generalized to a property called group asymmetry. Here we derive a generalized duality relation involving group asymmetry, which is closely related to the success probability of discriminating between the actions of the elements of a group. The second quantity in the duality relation, the one generalizing which-path information, is related to information about the irreducible representations that make up the group representation.},

In this way the optimization of the measurement operators can be carried out in successive steps, optimizing first the binary measurements at the deepest nesting level and then moving on to those at higher levels. We obtain an analytical expression for the maximum success probability after the first optimization step and examine its form for the specific case of N=3,4 states of a qubit. In this case, at variance with previous proposals, we are able to provide a compact expression for the success probability of any set of states, whose numerical optimization is straightforward; the results thus obtained highlight some lesser-known features of the discrimination problem.},

	Abstract = {We construct a new class of quantum error-correcting codes for a bosonic mode which are advantageous for applications in quantum memories, communication, and scalable computation. These 'binomial quantum codes' are formed from a finite superposition of Fock states weighted with binomial coefficients. The binomial codes can exactly correct errors that are polynomial up to a specific degree in bosonic creation and annihilation operators, including amplitude damping and displacement noise as well as boson addition and dephasing errors. For realistic continuous-time dissipative evolution, the codes can perform approximate quantum error correction to any given order in the timestep between error detection measurements. We present an explicit approximate quantum error recovery operation based on projective measurements and unitary operations. The binomial codes are tailored for detecting boson loss and gain errors by means of measurements of the generalized number parity. We discuss optimization of the binomial codes and demonstrate that by relaxing the parity structure, codes with even lower unrecoverable error rates can be achieved. The binomial codes are related to existing two-mode bosonic codes but offer the advantage of requiring only a single bosonic mode to correct amplitude damping as well as the ability to correct other errors. Our codes are similar in spirit to 'cat codes' based on superpositions of the coherent states, but offer several advantages such as smaller mean number, exact rather than approximate orthonormality of the code words, and an explicit unitary operation for repumping energy into the bosonic mode. The binomial quantum codes are realizable with current superconducting circuit technology and they should prove useful in other quantum technologies, including bosonic quantum memories, photonic quantum communication, and optical-to-microwave up- and down-conversion.},

@article{noMultiDol,
	Abstract = {It is well known that a minimum error quantum measurement for arbitrary binary optical coherent states can be realized by a receiver that comprises interfering with a coherent reference light, photon counting, and feedback control. We show that, for ternary optical coherent states, a minimum error measurement cannot always be realized by such a receiver. The problem of finding an upper bound on the maximum success probability of such a receiver can be formulated as a convex programming. We derive its dual problem and numerically find the upper bound. At least for ternary phase-shift keyed coherent states, this bound does not reach that of a minimum error measurement. Optical state discrimination is one of the most fun-damental issues in quantum optics and quantum infor-mation science. Since coherent beams of laser light are commonly used for optical communication and sensing applications, distinguishing optical coherent states as ac-curately as possible is an important task. A quantum measurement that maximizes the success probability for coherent states can be computed. However, it is a highly difficult problem how to physically implement such a measurement. In 1973, Dolinar [1] proposed a receiver based on a combination of a beam combiner, a local coherent light source, a photon detector, and a feedback circuit, and showed that this receiver realizes a measurement, called a minimum error measurement (MEM), that maximizes the success probability for binary coherent states. This was later demonstrated experimentally [2]. Following Dolinar's work, several theoretical and experimental at-tempts have been made to realize a receiver distinguish-ing binary coherent states [3--8]. Also, many receivers comprising interfering with a coherent reference light, photon counting, and feedback or feedforward control, which we call Dolinar-like receivers, have been proposed to distinguish more than two coherent states [9--15], and related experimental demonstrations have been reported [16--18]. However, it has been a long-standing question whether a Dolinar-like receiver can realize an MEM for more than two coherent states. It should be mentioned that a more complicated receiver realizing an MEM for more than two coherent states was proposed [19], but this receiver requires a special-purpose quantum computer, making it impractical at present. A coherent state |$\alpha$ of duration T can be divided into N time intervals of duration T /N : |$\alpha$ = |$\alpha$/ √ N ⊗ {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} ⊗ |$\alpha$/ √ N Let us consider a measurement, called a se-quential measurement, on the N systems that is realized by carrying out local measurements on the individual systems adaptively, where one adapts subsequent mea-surements based on the results of the previous ones. A Dolinar-like receiver can be thought of as a sequential measurement with the limit of N → ∞ (see Fig. 1). If {\%}HDP 3KRWRQ},

Despite these successes, the proximity to the physical limits of chip fabrication alongside the increasing size of datasets are motivating a growing number of researchers to explore the possibility of harnessing the power of quantum computation to speed-up classical machine learning algorithms. Here we review the literature in quantum machine learning and discuss perspectives for a mixed readership of classical machine learning and quantum computation experts. Particular emphasis will be placed on clarifying the limitations of quantum algorithms, how they compare with their best classical counterparts and why quantum resources are expected to provide advantages for learning problems. Learning in the presence of noise and certain computationally hard problems in machine learning are identified as promising directions for the field. Practical questions, like how to upload classical data into quantum form, will also be addressed.},

Here we demonstrate that systematic machine learning of the wave function can reduce this complexity to a tractable computational form, for some notable cases of physical interest. We introduce a variational representation of quantum states based on artificial neural networks with variable number of hidden neurons. A reinforcement-learning scheme is then demonstrated, capable of either finding the ground-state or describing the unitary time evolution of complex interacting quantum systems. We show that this approach achieves very high accuracy in the description of equilibrium and dynamical properties of prototypical interacting spins models in both one and two dimensions, thus offering a new powerful tool to solve the quantum many-body problem.},

We discuss the importance of the data-driven approach, compared with the formal modeling of traditional artificial intelligence. We outline how to build high-dimensional feature spaces that will correspond to quantum states in quantum computing. An algorithm's ability to generalize beyond training data is intrinsically linked with its complexity---this is the foundation of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory, which we briefly explain. There is no free lunch, however: a single algorithm will not work in every learning scenario, which leads to combinations of learners and ensembles. Dependence on the dimensions and volume of the data defines computational complexity for learning methods, which often do not scale well.},

@article{Guha2016,
	Abstract = {Many partially-successful attempts have been made to find the most natural discrete-variable version of Shannon's entropy power inequality (EPI). We develop an axiomatic framework from which we deduce the natural form of a discrete-variable EPI and an associated entropic monotonicity in a discrete-variable central limit theorem. In this discrete EPI, the geometric distribution, which has the maximum entropy among all discrete distributions with a given mean, assumes a role analogous to the Gaussian distribution in Shannon's EPI. The entropy power of {\$}X{\$} is defined as the mean of a geometric random variable with entropy {\$}H(X){\$}. The crux of our construction is a discrete-variable version of Lieb's scaled addition {\$}X \backslashboxplus{\_}\backslasheta Y{\$} of two discrete random variables {\$}X{\$} and {\$}Y{\$} with {\$}\backslasheta \backslashin (0, 1){\$}. We discuss the relationship of our discrete EPI with recent work of Yu and Johnson who developed an EPI for a restricted class of random variables that have ultra-log-concave (ULC) distributions. Even though we leave open the proof of the aforesaid natural form of the discrete EPI, we show that this discrete EPI holds true for variables with arbitrary discrete distributions when the entropy power is redefined as {\$}e{\^{}}{\{}H(X){\}}{\$} in analogy with the continuous version. Finally, we show that our conjectured discrete EPI is a special case of the yet-unproven Entropy Photon-number Inequality (EPnI), which assumes a role analogous to Shannon's EPI in capacity proofs for Gaussian bosonic (quantum) channels.},

	Abstract = {In low-rank matrix recovery, one aims to reconstruct a low-rank matrix from a minimal number of linear measurements. Within the paradigm of compressed sensing, this is made computationally efficient by minimizing the nuclear norm as a convex surrogate for rank. In this work, we identify an improved regularizer based on the so-called diamond norm, a concept imported from quantum information theory. We show that -for a class of matrices saturating a certain norm inequality- the descent cone of the diamond norm is contained in that of the nuclear norm. This suggests superior reconstruction properties for these matrices. We explicitly characterize this set of matrices. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically that the diamond norm indeed outperforms the nuclear norm in a number of relevant applications: These include signal analysis tasks such as blind matrix deconvolution or the retrieval of certain unitary basis changes, as well as the quantum information problem of process tomography with random measurements. The diamond norm is defined for matrices that can be interpreted as order-4 tensors and it turns out that the above condition depends crucially on that tensorial structure. In this sense, this work touches on an aspect of the notoriously difficult tensor completion problem.},

	Abstract = {We consider the quantum-classical correspondence from a classical perspective by discussing the potential for chaotic systems to support behaviors normally associated with quantum mechanical systems. Our main analytical tool is a chaotic system's set of cupolets, which are essentially highly-accurate stabilizations of its unstable periodic orbits. The discussion is motivated by the bound or entangled states that we have recently detected between interacting chaotic systems, wherein pairs of cupolets are induced into a state of mutually-sustaining stabilization that can be maintained without external intervention. This state is known as chaotic entanglement as it has been shown to exhibit several properties consistent with quantum entanglement. For instance, should the interaction be disturbed, then the chaotic entanglement would be broken. In this paper, we further describe chaotic entanglement and go on to discuss the capacity for chaotic systems to exhibit other characteristics that are conventionally associated with quantum mechanics, namely analogs to wave function collapse, the measurement problem, the superposition of states, and to quantum entropy definitions. In doing so, we argue that these characteristics need not be regarded exclusively as quantum mechanical.},

	Abstract = {Quantum state discrimination underlies various applications in quantum information processing tasks. It essentially describes the distinguishability of quantum systems in different states, and the general process of extracting classical information from quantum systems. It is also useful in quantum information applications, such as the characterisation of mutual information in cryptographic protocols, or as a technique to derive fundamental theorems in quantum foundations. It has deep connections to physical principles such as relativistic causality. Quantum state discrimination traces a long history of several decades, starting with the early attempts to formalise information processing of physical systems such as optical communication with photons. Nevertheless, in most cases, optimal strategies of quantum state discrimination remain unsolved, and related applications are valid in some limited cases only. The present review aims to provide an overview on quantum state discrimination, covering some recent progress, and addressing applications in some selected topics. This review serves to strengthen the link between results in quantum state discrimination and quantum information applications, by showing the ways in which the fundamental results are exploited in applications and vice versa.},

	Abstract = {We give operational meaning to wave-particle duality in terms of discrimination games. Duality arises as a constraint on the probability of winning these games. The games are played with the aid of an n-port interferometer, and involve 3 parties, Alice and Bob, who cooperate, and the House, who supervises the game. In one game called ways they attempt to determine the path of a particle in the interferometer. In another, called phases, they attempt to determine which set of known phases have been applied to the different paths. The House determines which game is to be played by flipping a coin. We find a tight wave-particle duality relation that allows us to relate the probabilities of winning these games, and use it to find an upper bound on the probability of winning the combined game. This procedure allows us to describe wave-particle duality in terms of discrimination probabilities.},

@article{Farsad2018,
	Abstract = {We consider the problem of joint source and channel coding of structured data such as natural language over a noisy channel. The typical approach to this problem in both theory and practice involves performing source coding to first compress the text and then channel coding to add robustness for the transmission across the channel. This approach is optimal in terms of minimizing end-to-end distortion with arbitrarily large block lengths of both the source and channel codes when transmission is over discrete memoryless channels. However, the optimality of this approach is no longer ensured for documents of finite length and limitations on the length of the encoding. We will show in this scenario that we can achieve lower word error rates by developing a deep learning based encoder and decoder. While the approach of separate source and channel coding would minimize bit error rates, our approach preserves semantic information of sentences by first embedding sentences in a semantic space where sentences closer in meaning are located closer together, and then performing joint source and channel coding on these embeddings.},

While quantum improvements in supervised and unsupervised learning have been reported, reinforcement learning has received much less attention. Within our approach, we tackle the problem of quantum enhancements in reinforcement learning as well, and propose a systematic scheme for providing improvements.

@article{Harrow2010,
	Abstract = {We give a test that can distinguish efficiently between product states of n quantum systems and states which are far from product. If applied to a state psi whose maximum overlap with a product state is 1-epsilon, the test passes with probability 1-Theta(epsilon), regardless of n or the local dimensions of the individual systems. The test uses two copies of psi. We prove correctness of this test as a special case of a more general result regarding stability of maximum output purity of the depolarising channel. A key application of the test is to quantum Merlin-Arthur games with multiple Merlins, where we obtain several structural results that had been previously conjectured, including the fact that efficient soundness amplification is possible and that two Merlins can simulate many Merlins: QMA(k)=QMA(2) for k{\textgreater}=2. Building on a previous result of Aaronson et al, this implies that there is an efficient quantum algorithm to verify 3-SAT with constant soundness, given two unentangled proofs of O(sqrt(n) polylog(n)) qubits. We also show how QMA(2) with log-sized proofs is equivalent to a large number of problems, some related to quantum information (such as testing separability of mixed states) as well as problems without any apparent connection to quantum mechanics (such as computing injective tensor norms of 3-index tensors). As a consequence, we obtain many hardness-of-approximation results, as well as potential algorithmic applications of methods for approximating QMA(2) acceptance probabilities. Finally, our test can also be used to construct an efficient test for determining whether a unitary operator is a tensor product, which is a generalisation of classical linearity testing.},

Although we do not prove the optimality, we show that the performance of the proposed setup is better than the generalization of the optimal measurement known for a finite-dimensional case. We show that a single beam splitter is capable to perform an unambiguous quantum state comparison for coherent states optimally. Finally, we propose an experimental setup consisting of 2N−1 beam splitters for unambiguous identification among N unknown coherent states. This setup can be considered as a search in a quantum database. The elements of the database are unknown coherent states encoded in different modes of an electromagnetic field.

@article{Wilde2013,
	Abstract = {Holevo, Schumacher, and Westmoreland's coding theorem guarantees the existence of codes that are capacity-achieving for the task of sending classical data over a channel with classical inputs and quantum outputs. Although they demonstrated the existence of such codes, their proof does not provide an explicit construction of codes for this task. The aim of the present paper is to fill this gap by constructing near-explicit "polar" codes that are capacity-achieving. The codes exploit the channel polarization phenomenon observed by Arikan for the case of classical channels. Channel polarization is an effect in which one can synthesize a set of channels, by "channel combining" and "channel splitting," in which a fraction of the synthesized channels are perfect for data transmission while the other fraction are completely useless for data transmission, with the good fraction equal to the capacity of the channel. The channel polarization effect then leads to a simple scheme for data transmission: send the information bits through the perfect channels and "frozen" bits through the useless ones. The main technical contributions of the present paper are threefold. First, we leverage several known results from the quantum information literature to demonstrate that the channel polarization effect occurs for channels with classical inputs and quantum outputs. We then construct linear polar codes based on this effect, and the encoding complexity is O(N log N), where N is the blocklength of the code. We also demonstrate that a quantum successive cancellation decoder works well, in the sense that the word error rate decays exponentially with the blocklength of the code. For this last result, we exploit Sen's recent "non-commutative union bound" that holds for a sequence of projectors applied to a quantum state.},

	Abstract = {Thompson sampling is an algorithm for online decision problems where actions are taken sequentially in a manner that must balance between exploiting what is known to maximize immediate performance and investing to accumulate new information that may improve future performance. The algorithm addresses a broad range of problems in a computationally efficient manner and is therefore enjoying wide use. This tutorial covers the algorithm and its application, illustrating concepts through a range of examples, including Bernoulli bandit problems, shortest path problems, dynamic pricing, recommendation, active learning with neural networks, and reinforcement learning in Markov decision processes. Most of these problems involve complex information structures, where information revealed by taking an action informs beliefs about other actions. We will also discuss when and why Thompson sampling is or is not effective and relations to alternative algorithms.},

Our framework is based on the concepts of quantum comb-which describes all transformations achievable by a given quantum network-and link product-the operation of connecting two quantum networks. Quantum networks are treated both from a constructive point of view-based on connections of elementary circuits-and from an axiomatic one-based on a hierarchy of admissible quantum maps. In the axiomatic context a fundamental property is shown, which we call universality of quantum memory channels: any admissible transformation of quantum networks can be realized by a suitable sequence of memory channels. The open problem whether this property fails for some nonquantum theory, e.g., for no-signaling boxes, is posed.},

	Abstract = {Coding theorems in quantum Shannon theory express the ultimate rates at which a sender can transmit information over a noisy quantum channel. More often than not, the known formulas expressing these transmission rates are intractable, requiring an optimization over an infinite number of uses of the channel. Researchers have rarely found quantum channels with a tractable classical or quantum capacity, but when such a finding occurs, it demonstrates a complete understanding of that channel's capabilities for transmitting classical or quantum information. Here, we show that the three-dimensional capacity region for entanglement-assisted transmission of classical and quantum information is tractable for the Hadamard class of channels. Examples of Hadamard channels include generalized dephasing channels, cloning channels, and the Unruh channel. The generalized dephasing channels and the cloning channels are natural processes that occur in quantum systems through the loss of quantum coherence or stimulated emission, respectively. The Unruh channel is a noisy process that occurs in relativistic quantum information theory as a result of the Unruh effect and bears a strong relationship to the cloning channels. We give exact formulas for the entanglement-assisted classical and quantum communication capacity regions of these channels. The coding strategy for each of these examples is superior to a naive time-sharing strategy, and we introduce a measure to determine this improvement.},

	Abstract = {This is a review article of finite-block-length analysis in classical and quantum information theory for non-specialist. Transmitting an information is a fundamental technology. However, there are several demands for this transmission. The research area to study such problems is called information theory. In the information transmission, the information is transmitted via a physical media. Hence, the analysis of this problem might depends on the property of the physical media. Indeed, while it is ideal that the analysis does not depend on this property, it depends on the following classification of the physical media. Currently, we have two kinds of physical objects, the first one is a macroscopic object, i.e., an object subject to classical physics, and the second one is a microscopic object, i.e., an object subject to quantum physics. Since these two objects have completely different behaviors, we need to build up information theory dependently of these two information media. That is, we have classical information theory and quantum information theory. In both information theory, there are very elegant theoretical results with an ideal assumption. That is, we often assume that infinitely large size of the system is available while the real situation does not satisfy this assumption. Hence, to discuss the real case, we need to care about the finite size effect of the system size. This paper reviews this finite size effect in classical and quantum information theory with respect to various topics.},

	Abstract = {Finding the optimal encoding strategies can be challenging for communication using quantum channels, as classical and quantum capacities may be superadditive. Entanglement assistance can often simplify this task, as the entanglement-assisted classical capacity for any channel is additive, making entanglement across channel uses unnecessary. If the entanglement assistance is limited, the picture is much more unclear. Suppose the classical capacity is superadditive, then the classical capacity with limited entanglement assistance could retain superadditivity by continuity arguments. If the classical capacity is additive, it is unknown if superadditivity can still be developed with limited entanglement assistance. We show this is possible, by providing an example. We construct a channel for which, the classical capacity is additive, but that with limited entanglement assistance can be superadditive. This shows entanglement plays a weird role in communication and we still understand very little about it.},

	Abstract = {IN elaborating the relations of the present conmmunication interest was not centred upon the interpretation of particular data, but grew out of a general interest in problems of research planning. From this point of view there can be no objection to the use of data, however meagre, as a guide to action required before more can be collected; although serious objection can otherwise be raised to argument based upon a small number of observations. Indeed, the fact that such objection can never be eliminated entirely-no matter how great the number of observations-suggested the possible value of seeking other modes of operation than that of taking a large number of observations before analysis or any attemipt to direct our course. This problem is more general than that treated in Section 2, and is directly con-cerned with any case where probability criteria may be established by means of which we judge whether one mode of operation is better than another in some given sense or not. Thus, if, in this sense, P is the probability estimnate that one treatment of a certain class of individuals is better than a second, as judged by data at present available, then we might take some monotone increasing function of P, sayf(p), to fix the fraction of such individuals to be treated in the first manner; until more evidence may be utilised, where 0 {\textless}{\_} fp) {\textless} 1; the remaining fraction of such individuals (1 -f(p)) to be treated in the second manner; or we may establish a probability of treatment by the two methods of f(p) and 1 -f(p), respectively. If such a discipline were adopted, even though it were not the best possible, it seems apparent that a considerable saving of individuals otherwise sacrificed to the inferior treatment might be effected. This would be imnportant in cases where either the rate of accumulation of data is slow or the individuals treated are valuable, or both. If we arbitrarily decide to eliminate the second treatment in favour of the first at this time, then the expectation of sacrifice to the inferior treatment would be (1 -P) for all subsequently treated individuals; whereas, if, for example, we take f(p) = P, the expectation of such sacrifice would be temporartly This content downloaded from 143.89.58.9 on Thu, 30 Nov 2017 08:26:26 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms},

The efficiency, quantified using Shannon mutual information, is optimized with respect to the PPM order under the constraint of a given average signal power in simple and complete decoding scenarios. We show that the use of complete decoding, which retrieves information from all combinations of detector photocounts occurring within one PPM frame, allows one to achieve information efficiency scaling as the inverse of the square of the distance, i.e. proportional to the received signal power. This represents a qualitative enhancement compared to simple decoding, which treats multiple photocounts within a single PPM frame as erasures and leads to inverse-quartic scaling with the distance.

	Abstract = {We present novel techniques for analyzing the problem of low-rank matrix recovery. The methods are both considerably simpler and more general than previous approaches. It is shown that an unknown (n x n) matrix of rank r can be efficiently reconstructed from only O(n r nu log{\^{}}2 n) randomly sampled expansion coefficients with respect to any given matrix basis. The number nu quantifies the "degree of incoherence" between the unknown matrix and the basis. Existing work concentrated mostly on the problem of "matrix completion" where one aims to recover a low-rank matrix from randomly selected matrix elements. Our result covers this situation as a special case. The proof consists of a series of relatively elementary steps, which stands in contrast to the highly involved methods previously employed to obtain comparable results. In cases where bounds had been known before, our estimates are slightly tighter. We discuss operator bases which are incoherent to all low-rank matrices simultaneously. For these bases, we show that O(n r nu log n) randomly sampled expansion coefficients suffice to recover any low-rank matrix with high probability. The latter bound is tight up to multiplicative constants.},

	Abstract = {Measurement of the state of a quantum system with inherent quantum uncertainty (noise) approaching the ultimate physical limits is of both technological and fundamental interest. Quantum noise prevents any mutually nonorthogonal quantum states, such as coherent states, from being distinguished with perfect accuracy. Optimized quantum measurements for nonorthogonal coherent states allow, in principle, for state discrimination sensitivities surpassing the standard quantum limit. Realizing quantum receivers that can detect multiple coherent states with sensitivity levels approaching the ultimate quantum limits is fundamental to quantum-enhanced measurements, and can optimize the performance of quantum and classical communications as well as future implementations of quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate the first quantum receiver that unconditionally discriminates four nonorthogonal coherent states with error probabilities below the standard quantum limit. This receiver achieves error rates four times lower than is possible with any ideal conventional receiver with perfect detection efficiency.},

	Abstract = {The relation between the theory of entanglement and thermodynamics is very tight: a thermodynamic theory of quantum entanglement, as well as the establishment of rigorous formal connections between the laws of thermodynamics and the phenomenology of entanglement are currently open areas of investigation. In this quest, an interesting problem is embodied by the role played by entanglement in processes of work extraction from a working medium embodied by quantum information carriers. In this work, we experimentally address the question "Is there any intrinsic advantage for work extraction given by the use of an entangled working medium?". By addressing work-extraction protocols based on a mechanism intimately linked to the paradigm of Maxwell's daemon, and implementing suitably designed multi-photon optical interferometers, we demonstrate experimentally the intrinsic advantages for such tasks provided by bipartite and genuine multipartite entanglement. We highlight the unique nature of such tests by comparing their performance to standard tests for the inseparability of multi-photon state resources. Our work contributes strongly to the ongoing efforts in establishing photonic systems as a platform for experiments for information thermodynamics.},

@article{DaSilva2013,
	Abstract = {Laser light is widely used for communication and sensing applications, so the optimal discrimination of coherent states---the quantum states of light emitted by an ideal laser---has immense practical importance. Due to fundamental limits imposed by quantum mechanics, such discrimination has a finite minimum probability of error. While concrete optical circuits for the optimal discrimination between two coherent states are well known, the generalization to larger sets of coherent states has been challenging. In this paper, we show how to achieve optimal discrimination of any set of coherent states using a resource-efficient quantum computer. Our construction leverages a recent result on discriminating multicopy quantum hypotheses [Blume-Kohout, Croke, and Zwolak, arXiv:1201.6625]. As illustrative examples, we analyze the performance of discriminating a ternary alphabet and showhowthe quantum circuit of a receiver designed to discriminate a binary alphabet can be reused in discriminating multimode hypotheses. Finally, we show that our result can be used to achieve the quantum limit on the rate of classical information transmission on a lossy optical channel, which is known to exceed the Shannon rate of all conventional optical receivers.

@article{Chitambar2019,
	Abstract = {Quantum resource theories (QRTs) offer a highly versatile and powerful framework for studying different phenomena in quantum physics. From quantum entanglement to quantum computation, resource theories can be used to quantify a desirable quantum effect, develop new protocols for its detection, and identify processes that optimize its use for a given application. Particularly, QRTs revolutionize the way we think about familiar properties of physical systems like entanglement, elevating them from just being interesting from a fundamental point of view to being useful in performing practical tasks. The basic methodology of a general QRT involves partitioning all quantum states into two groups, one consisting of free states and the other consisting of resource states. Accompanying the set of free states is a collection of free quantum operations arising from natural restrictions on physical systems, and that consists of all the physical processes allowed by the resource theory and which acts invariantly on the set of free states. The QRT then studies what information processing tasks become possible using the restricted operations. Despite the large degree of freedom in how one defines the free states and free operations, unexpected similarities emerge among different QRTs in terms of resource measures and resource convertibility. As a result, objects that appear quite distinct on the surface, such as entanglement and quantum reference frames, appear to have great similarity on a deeper structural level. In this article we review the general framework of a quantum resource theory, focusing on common structural features, operational tasks, and resource measures. To illustrate these concepts, an overview is provided on some of the more commonly studied QRTs in the literature.},

We show that the design of the optimal detector can be formulated as a semidefinite programming problem. Based on this formulation, we derive a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for an optimal quantum measurement. We then show that the optimal measurement can be found by solving a standard (convex) semidefinite program followed by the solution of a set of linear equations or, at worst, a standard linear programming problem. By exploiting the many well-known algorithms for solving semidefinite programs, which are guaranteed to converge to the global optimum, the optimal measurement can be computed very efficiently in polynomial time. Using the semidefinite programming formulation, we also show that the rank of each optimal measurement operator is no larger than the rank of the corresponding density operator. In particular, if the quantum state ensemble is a pure-state ensemble consisting of (not necessarily independent) rank-one density operators, then we show that the optimal measurement is a pure-state measurement consisting of rank-one measurement operators.},

	Abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) recently emerged as one of the most competitive approaches for learning in sequential decision making problems with fully observable environments, e.g., computer Go. However, very little work has been done in deep RL to handle partially observable environments. We propose a new architecture called Action-specific Deep Recurrent Q-Network (ADRQN) to enhance learning performance in partially observable domains. Actions are encoded by a fully connected layer and coupled with a convolutional observation to form an action-observation pair. The time series of action-observation pairs are then integrated by an LSTM layer that learns latent states based on which a fully connected layer computes Q-values as in conventional Deep Q-Networks (DQNs). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our new architecture in several partially observable domains, including flickering Atari games.},

	Abstract = {An ideal phase-preserving linear amplifier is a deterministic device that adds to an input signal the minimal amount of noise consistent with the constraints imposed by quantum mechanics. A noiseless linear amplifier takes an input coherent state to an amplified coherent state, but only works part of the time. Such a device is actually better than noiseless, since the output has less noise than the amplified noise of the input coherent state; for this reason we refer to such devices as {\{}$\backslash$em immaculate{\}}. Here we bound the working probabilities of probabilistic and approximate immaculate amplifiers and construct theoretical models that achieve some of these bounds. Our chief conclusions are the following: (i) the working probability of any phase-insensitive immaculate amplifier is very small in the phase-plane region where the device works with high fidelity; (ii) phase-sensitive immaculate amplifiers that work only on coherent states sparsely distributed on a phase-plane circle centered at the origin can have a reasonably high working probability.},

	Abstract = {Quantum communication theory explores the implications of quantum mechanics to the tasks of information transmission. Many physical channels can be formally described as quantum Gaussian operations acting on bosonic quantum states. Depending on the input state and on the quality of the channel, the output suffers certain amount of noise. For a long time it has been conjectured, but never proved, that output states of Gaussian channels corresponding to coherent input signals are the less noisy ones (in the sense of a majorization criterion). Here we prove this conjecture. Specifically we show that every output state of a phase-insensitive Gaussian channel is majorized by the output state corresponding to a coherent input. The proof is based on the optimality of coherent states for the minimization of strictly concave output functionals. Moreover we show that coherent states are the unique optimizers.},

	Abstract = {Among several tasks in Machine Learning, a specially important one is that of inferring the latent variables of a system and their causal relations with the observed behavior. Learning a Hidden Markov Model of given stochastic process is a textbook example, known as the positive realization problem (PRP). The PRP and its solutions have far-reaching consequences in many areas of systems and control theory, and positive systems theory. We consider the scenario where the latent variables are quantum states, and the system dynamics is constrained only by physical transformations on the quantum system. The observable dynamics is then described by a quantum instrument, and the task is to determine which quantum instrument --if any-- yields the process at hand by iterative application. We take as starting point the theory of quasi-realizations, whence a description of the dynamics of the process is given in terms of linear maps on state vectors and probabilities are given by linear functionals on the state vectors. This description, despite its remarkable resemblance with the Hidden Markov Model, or the iterated quantum instrument, is nevertheless devoid of any stochastic or quantum mechanical interpretation, as said maps fail to satisfy any positivity conditions. The Completely-Positive realization problem then consists in determining whether an equivalent quantum mechanical description of the same process exists. We generalize some key results of stochastic realization theory, and show that the problem has deep connections with operator systems theory, yielding possible insight to the lifting problem in quotient operator systems. Our results have potential applications in quantum machine learning, device-independent characterization and reverse-engineering of stochastic processes and quantum processors, and dynamical processes with quantum memory.},

We study a new problem: the qubits in a physical system might not be independent. They can " overlap, " in the sense that an operation on one qubit slightly affects the others. We show that allowing for slight overlaps, n qubits can fit in just polynomially many dimensions. (Defined in a natural way, all pairwise overlaps can be ≤ in n O(1// 2) dimensions.) Thus, even before considering issues like noise, a real system of n qubits might inherently lack any potential for exponential power. On the other hand, we also provide an efficient test to certify exponential dimensionality. Unfortunately, the test is sensitive to noise. It is important to devise more robust tests on the arrangements of qubits in quantum devices.},

	Abstract = {The development of optical nanofibers (ONF) and the study and control of their optical properties when coupling atoms to their electromagnetic modes has opened new possibilities for their use in quantum optics and quantum information science. These ONFs offer tight optical mode confinement (less than the wavelength of light) and diffraction-free propagation. The small cross section of the transverse field allows probing of linear and non-linear spectroscopic features of atoms with exquisitely low power. The cooperativity -- the figure of merit in many quantum optics and quantum information systems -- tends to be large even for a single atom in the mode of an ONF, as it is proportional to the ratio of the atomic cross section to the electromagnetic mode cross section. ONFs offer a natural bus for information and for inter-atomic coupling through the tightly-confined modes, which opens the possibility of one-dimensional many-body physics and interesting quantum interconnection applications. The presence of the ONF modifies the vacuum field, affecting the spontaneous emission rates of atoms in its vicinity. The high gradients in the radial intensity naturally provide the potential for trapping atoms around the ONF, allowing the creation of one-dimensional arrays of atoms. The same radial gradient in the transverse direction of the field is responsible for the existence of a large longitudinal component that introduces the possibility of spin-orbit coupling of the light and the atom, enabling the exploration of chiral quantum optics.},

The method generalizes the standard belief propagation algorithm by assigning weights to the edges of the Tanner graph. These edges are then trained using deep learning techniques. A well-known property of the belief propagation algorithm is the independence of the performance on the transmitted codeword. A crucial property of our new method is that our decoder preserved this property. Furthermore, this property allows us to learn only a single codeword instead of exponential number of code-words.

	Abstract = {In spite of their simple description in terms of rotations or symplectic transformations in phase space, quadratic Hamiltonians such as those modelling the most common Gaussian operations on bosonic modes remain poorly understood in terms of entropy production. For instance, determining the quantum entropy generated by a Bogoliubov transformation is notably a hard problem, with generally no known analytical solution, while it is vital to the characterisation of quantum communication via bosonic channels. Here we overcome this difficulty by adapting the replica method, a tool borrowed from statistical physics and quantum field theory. We exhibit a first application of this method to continuous-variable quantum information theory, where it enables accessing entropies in an optical parametric amplifier. As an illustration, we determine the entropy generated by amplifying a binary superposition of the vacuum and a Fock state, which yields a surprisingly simple, yet unknown analytical expression.},

	Abstract = {We develop a quantum learning scheme for binary discrimination of coherent states of light. This is a problem of technological relevance for the reading of information stored in a digital memory. In our setting, a coherent light source is used to illuminate a memory cell and retrieve its encoded bit by determining the quantum state of the reflected signal. We consider a situation where the amplitude of the states produced by the source is not fully known, but instead this information is encoded in a large training set comprising many copies of the same coherent state. We show that an optimal global measurement, performed jointly over the signal and the training set, provides higher successful identification rates than any learning strategy based on first estimating the unknown amplitude by means of Gaussian measurements on the training set, followed by an adaptive discrimination procedure on the signal. By considering a simplified variant of the problem, we argue that this is the case even for non-Gaussian estimation measurements. Our results show that, even in absence of entanglement, collective quantum measurements yield an enhancement in the readout of classical information, which is particularly relevant in the operating regime of low-energy signals.},

	Abstract = {Optical channels, such as fibers or free-space links, are ubiquitous in today's telecommunication networks. They rely on the electromagnetic field associated with photons to carry information from one point to another in space. As a result, a complete physical model of these channels must necessarily take quantum effects into account in order to determine their ultimate performances. Specifically, Gaussian photonic (or bosonic) quantum channels have been extensively studied over the past decades given their importance for practical purposes. In spite of this, a longstanding conjecture on the optimality of Gaussian encodings has yet prevented finding their communication capacity. Here, this conjecture is solved by proving that the vacuum state achieves the minimum output entropy of a generic Gaussian bosonic channel. This establishes the ultimate achievable bit rate under an energy constraint, as well as the long awaited proof that the single-letter classical capacity of these channels is additive. Beyond capacities, it also has broad consequences in quantum information sciences.},

Traditional quantum state tomography requires a number of measurements that grows exponentially with the number of qubits n. But using ideas from computational learning theory, we show that one can do exponentially better in a statistical setting. In particular, to predict the outcomes of most measurements drawn from an arbitrary probability distribution, one needs only a number of sample measurements that grows linearly with n. This theorem has the conceptual implication that quantum states, despite being exponentially long vectors, are nevertheless 'reasonable' in a learning theory sense. The theorem also has two applications to quantum computing: first, a new simulation of quantum one-way communication protocols and second, the use of trusted classical advice to verify untrusted quantum advice.},

	Abstract = {Several quantities of interest in quantum information, including entanglement and purity, are nonlinear functions of the density matrix and cannot, even in principle, correspond to proper quantum observables. Any method aimed to determine the value of these quantities should resort to indirect measurements and thus corresponds to a parameter estimation problem whose solution, i.e. the determination of the most precise estimator, unavoidably involves an optimization procedure. We review local quantum estimation theory and present explicit formulas for the symmetric logarithmic derivative and the quantum Fisher information of relevant families of quantum states. Estimability of a parameter is defined in terms of the quantum signal-to-noise ratio and the number of measurements needed to achieve a given relative error. The connections between the optmization procedure and the geometry of quantum statistical models are discussed. Our analysis allows to quantify quantum noise in the measurements of non observab...},

	Abstract = {One of the best signatures of nonclassicality in a quantum system is the existence of correlations that have no classical counterpart. Different methods for quantifying the quantum and classical parts of correlations are amongst the more actively-studied topics of quantum information theory over the past decade. Entanglement is the most prominent of these correlations, but in many cases unentangled states exhibit nonclassical behavior too. Thus distinguishing quantum correlations other than entanglement provides a better division between the quantum and classical worlds, especially when considering mixed states. Here we review different notions of classical and quantum correlations quantified by quantum discord and other related measures. In the first half, we review the mathematical properties of the measures of quantum correlations, relate them to each other, and discuss the classical-quantum division that is common among them. In the second half, we show that the measures identify and quantify the deviation from classicality in various quantum-information-processing tasks, quantum thermodynamics, open-system dynamics, and many-body physics. We show that in many cases quantum correlations indicate an advantage of quantum methods over classical ones.},

	Abstract = {We establish three different upper bounds on the energy-constrained quantum and private capacities of bosonic thermal channels. The first upper bound, which we call the "data-processing bound," is obtained by decomposing a thermal channel as a pure-loss channel followed by a quantum-limited amplifier channel. We prove that the data-processing bound can be at most 1.45 bits larger than a known lower bound on these capacities of the thermal channel. The other two upper bounds, which we call the "{\$}\backslashvarepsilon{\$}-degradable bound" and the {\$}\backslash"varepsilon{\$}-close-degradable bound," are established using the notion of approximate degradability along with energy constraints. A comparison of these three bounds shows that the data-processing bound is near to a known lower bound for both low and high thermal noise and is very near to the {\$}\backslashvarepsilon{\$}-close-degradable bound only for low thermal noise. Moreover, for certain parameter regimes, we show that the {\$}\backslashvarepsilon{\$}-degradable bound is tighter than all other bounds. All three upper bounds are very near to a known lower bound for the case of low thermal noise and high transmissivity. We also find improved achievable rates of private communication through bosonic thermal channels, by employing coding schemes that make use of displaced thermal states. We end by proving that an optimal Gaussian input state for the energy-constrained, generalized channel divergence of two particular Gaussian channels is the two-mode squeezed vacuum state that saturates the energy constraint. What remains open for several interesting channel divergences, such as the diamond norm or the R$\backslash$'enyi channel divergence, is to determine whether, among all input states, a Gaussian state is optimal.},

	Abstract = {Generative adversarial networks represent a powerful tool for classical machine learning: a generator tries to create statistics for data that mimics those of a true data set, while a discriminator tries to discriminate between the true and fake data. The learning process for generator and discriminator can be thought of as an adversarial game, and under reasonable assumptions, the game converges to the point where the generator generates the same statistics as the true data and the discriminator is unable to discriminate between the true and the generated data. This Letter introduces the notion of quantum generative adversarial networks, where the data consist either of quantum states or of classical data, and the generator and discriminator are equipped with quantum information processors. We show that the unique fixed point of the quantum adversarial game also occurs when the generator produces the same statistics as the data. Neither the generator nor the discriminator perform quantum tomography; linear programing drives them to the optimal. Since quantum systems are intrinsically probabilistic, the proof of the quantum case is different from - and simpler than - the classical case. We show that, when the data consist of samples of measurements made on high-dimensional spaces, quantum adversarial networks may exhibit an exponential advantage over classical adversarial networks.},

	Abstract = {Quantum technologies are developing powerful tools to generate and manipulate coherent superpositions of different energy levels. Envisaging a new generation of energy-efficient quantum devices, here we explore how coherence can be manipulated without exchanging energy with the surrounding environment. We start from the task of converting a coherent superposition of energy eigenstates into another. We identify the optimal energy-preserving operations, both in the deterministic and in the probabilistic scenario. We then design a recursive protocol, wherein a branching sequence of energy-preserving filters increases the probability of success while reaching maximum fidelity at each iteration. Building on the recursive protocol, we construct efficient approximations of the optimal fidelity-probability trade-off, by taking coherent superpositions of the different branches generated by probabilistic filtering. The benefits of this construction are illustrated in applications to quantum metrology, quantum cloning, coherent state amplification, and ancilla-driven computation. Finally, we extend our results to transitions where the input state is generally mixed and we apply our findings to the task of purifying quantum coherence.},

We consider the situation in which this measurement takes an appreciable time. In this case the measurement must be described by a continuous measurement process. We consider a continuous implementation of the optimal measurement for distinguishing between two non-orthogonal states, and show that feedback control can be used during this measurement to increase the rate at which the information regarding the initial preparation is obtained. We show that while the maximum obtainable increase is modest, the effect is purely quantum mechanical in the sense that the enhancement is only possible when the initial states are non-orthogonal. We find further that the enhancement in the rate of information gain is achieved at the expense of reducing the total information which the measurement can extract in the long-time limit.},

The efficiency, quantified using Shannon mutual information, is optimized with respect to the PPM order under the constraint of a given average signal power in simple and complete decoding scenarios. We show that the use of complete decoding, which retrieves information from all combinations of detector photocounts occurring within one PPM frame, allows one to achieve information efficiency scaling as the inverse of the square of the distance, i.e. proportional to the received signal power. This represents a qualitative enhancement compared to simple decoding, which treats multiple photocounts within a single PPM frame as erasures and leads to inverse-quartic scaling with the distance. We provide easily computable formulas for the link performance in the limit of diminishing signal power.},

	Abstract = {"Is entanglement monogamous?" asks the title of a popular article [B. Terhal, IBM J. Res. Dev. 48, 71 (2004)], celebrating C. H. Bennett's legacy on quantum information theory. While the answer is certainly affirmative in the qualitative sense, the situation is far less clear if monogamy is intended as a quantitative limitation on the distribution of bipartite entanglement in a multipartite system, given some particular measure of entanglement. Here, we clarify the most general form of a universal quantitative monogamy relation for a bipartite measure of entanglement. We then go on to show that an important class of entanglement measures fail to be monogamous in this most general sense of the term, with monogamy violations becoming generic with increasing dimension. In particular, we show that entanglement measures cannot satisfy monogamy while at the same time faithfully capturing the entanglement of the fully antisymmetric state in arbitrary dimension. Nevertheless, monogamy can be recovered if one allows for dimension-dependent relations, as we show explicitly with relevant examples.},

	Abstract = {Quantum machine learning has received significant attention in recent years, and promising progress has been made in the development of quantum algorithms to speed up traditional machine learning tasks. In this work, however, we focus on investigating the information-theoretic upper bounds of sample complexity - how many training samples are sufficient to predict the future behaviour of an unknown target function. This kind of problem is, arguably, one of the most fundamental problems in statistical learning theory and the bounds for practical settings can be completely characterised by a simple measure of complexity. Our main result in the paper is that, for learning an unknown quantum measurement, the upper bound, given by the fat-shattering dimension, is linearly proportional to the dimension of the underlying Hilbert space. Learning an unknown quantum state becomes a dual problem to ours, and as a byproduct, we can recover Aaronson's famous result [Proc. R. Soc. A 463:3089-3144 (2007)] solely using a classical machine learning technique. In addition, other famous complexity measures like covering numbers and Rademacher complexities are derived explicitly. We are able to connect measures of sample complexity with various areas in quantum information science, e.g. quantum state/measurement tomography, quantum state discrimination and quantum random access codes, which may be of independent interest. Lastly, with the assistance of general Bloch-sphere representation, we show that learning quantum measurements/states can be mathematically formulated as a neural network. Consequently, classical ML algorithms can be applied to efficiently accomplish the two quantum learning tasks.},

	Abstract = {Quantum metrology utilizes nonclassical resources, such as entanglement or squeezed light, to realize sensors whose performance exceeds that afforded by classical-state systems. Environmental loss and noise, however, easily destroy nonclassical resources, and thus nullify the performance advantages of most quantum-enhanced sensors. Quantum illumination (QI) is different. It is a robust entanglement-enhanced sensing scheme whose 6 dB performance advantage over a coherent-state sensor of the same average transmitted photon number survives the initial entanglement's eradication by loss and noise. Unfortunately, an implementation of the optimum quantum receiver that would reap QI's full performance advantage has remained elusive, owing to its having to deal with a huge number of very noisy optical modes. We show how sum-frequency generation (SFG) can be fruitfully applied to optimum multi-mode Gaussian-mixed-state discrimination. Applied to QI, our analysis and numerical evaluations demonstrate that our SFG receiver saturates QI's quantum Chernoff bound. Moreover, augmenting our SFG receiver with a feed-forward (FF) mechanism pushes its performance to the Helstrom bound in the limit of low signal brightness. The FF-SFG receiver thus opens the door to optimum quantum-enhanced imaging, radar detection, state and channel tomography, and communication in practical Gaussian-state situations.},

Here we investigate the problem in the quantum domain, considering a source that emits particles in a default state, until a point where it switches to another state. Given a sequence of particles emitted by the source, the problem is to find out where the change occurred. For large sequences, we obtain an analytical expression for the maximum probability of correctly identifying the change point when joint measurements on the whole sequence are allowed. We also construct strategies that measure the particles individually and provide an online answer as soon as a new particle is emitted by the source. We show that these strategies substantially underperform the optimal strategy, indicating that quantum sudden changes, although happening locally, are better detected globally.},

	Abstract = {Quantum communications promises reliable transmission of quantum information, efficient distribution of entanglement and generation of completely secure keys. For all these tasks there is a crucial question to answer: What are their optimal rates without quantum repeaters? Our work solves this basic question for any two parties connected by a quantum channel, without any restriction on their classical communication, which can be unlimited and two-way. We design a method which reduces the most general protocol of quantum communication to the computation of a novel quantity, identified as the channel's relative entropy of entanglement. In this way, we bound the ultimate rates that are achievable over the most important bosonic and qubit channels, computing a number of exact formulas for their two-way capacities. In particular, we determine the fundamental rate-loss scaling which affects any quantum optical communication. By setting these limits, we establish the most general and correct benchmarks for testing the performance of quantum repeaters.},

They present a lower bound on the asymptotic performance of uniformly good allocation rules and construct an allocation scheme that achieves the bound. It is found that despite the inclusion of a switching cost the proposed allocation scheme achieves the same asymptotic performance as the optimal rule for the bandit problem without switching cost. This is made possible by grouping together samples into blocks of increasing sizes, thereby reducing the number of switches to O(log {\textless}e1{\textgreater}n{\textless}/e1{\textgreater}).

Beyond quantum state tomography and without its identical copies assumption, we also derive a general protocol for verifying continuous variable pure quantum states with Gaussian measurements against fully malicious adversaries. In particular, we make use of a De Finetti reduction for infinite-dimensional systems. As an application, we consider verified universal continuous variable quantum computing, with a computational power restricted to Gaussian operations and an untrusted non-Gaussian states source. These results are obtained using a new analytical estimator for the expected value of any operator acting on a continuous variable quantum state with bounded support over Fock basis, computed with samples from heterodyne detection of the state.},

In particular, we first prove that there exists a trade-off between communication rate and error probability if one imposes only a mean-photon number constraint on the channel inputs. That is, if we demand that the mean number of photons at the channel input cannot be any larger than some positive number N{\_}S, then it is possible to respect this constraint with a code that operates at a rate g($\backslash$eta N{\_}S / (1-p)) where p is the code's error probability, $\backslash$eta$\backslash$ is the channel transmissivity, and g(x) is the entropy of a bosonic thermal state with mean photon number x. We then prove that a strong converse theorem holds for the classical capacity of this channel (that such a rate-error trade-off cannot occur) if one instead demands for a maximum photon number constraint, in such a way that mostly all of the "shadow" of the average density operator for a given code is required to be on a subspace with photon number no larger than n N{\_}S, so that the shadow outside this subspace vanishes as the number n of channel uses becomes large. Finally, we prove that a small modification of the well-known coherent-state coding scheme meets this more demanding constraint.},

By varying the inconclusive rate, the scheme optimally interpolates between Unambiguous and Minimum Error discrimination, the two standard approaches to quantum state discrimination. We introduce a very general method that enables us to obtain the solution in a wide range of cases and give a complete characterization of the minimum discrimination error as a function of the rate of inconclusive answers. A critical value of this rate is identified that coincides with the minimum failure probability in the cases where unambiguous discrimination is possible and provides a natural generalization of it when states cannot be unambiguously discriminated. The method is illustrated on two explicit examples: discrimination of two pure states with arbitrary prior probabilities and discrimination of trine states.},

	Abstract = {The past decade has seen a significant breakthrough in research on solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Where past solvers could not scale beyond perhaps a dozen states, modern solvers can handle complex domains with many thousands of states. This breakthrough was mainly due to the idea of restricting value function computations to a finite subset of the belief space, permitting only local value updates for this subset. This approach, known as point-based value iteration, avoids the exponential growth of the value function, and is thus applicable for domains with longer horizons, even with relatively large state spaces. Many extensions were suggested to this basic idea, focusing on various aspects of the algorithm-mainly the selection of the belief space subset, and the order of value function updates. In this survey, we walk the reader through the fundamentals of point-based value iteration, explaining the main concepts and ideas. Then, we survey the major extensions to the basic algorithm, discussing their merits. Finally, we include an extensive empirical analysis using well known benchmarks, in order to shed light on the strengths and limitations of the various approaches. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model fam-ily, or to the regularization techniques used during training. Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional ap-proaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a ran-dom labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by com-pletely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks al-ready have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice. We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models.},

	Abstract = {Quantum key distribution (QKD) permits information-theoretically secure transmission of digital encryption keys, assuming that the behavior of the devices employed for the key exchange can be reliably modeled and predicted. Remarkably, no assumptions have to be made on the capabilities of an eavesdropper other than that she is bounded by the laws of nature, thus making the security of QKD " unconditional. " However, unconditional security is hard to achieve in practice. For example, any experimental realization can only collect finite data samples, leading to vulner-abilities against coherent attacks, the most general class of attacks, and for some protocols the theoretical proof of robustness against these attacks is still missing. For these reasons, in the past many QKD experiments have fallen short of implementing an unconditionally secure protocol and have instead considered limited attacking capabilities by the eavesdropper. Here, we explore the security of QKD against coherent attacks in the most challenging environment: the long-distance transmission of keys. We demonstrate that the BB84 protocol can provide positive key rates for distances up to 240 km without multiplexing of conventional signals, and up to 200 km with multiplexing. Useful key rates can be achieved even for the longest distances, using practical thermo-electrically cooled single-photon detectors.

The positive operator-valued measure (POM) which satisfies the necessary and sufficient condition for the minimization of the average probability of error is derived by using the quantum Bayes strategy.

@article{Krovi2014,
	Abstract = {The minimum probability of error (MPE) measurement discriminates between a set of candidate quantum states with the minimum average error probability allowed by quantum mechanics. Conditions for a measurement to be MPE were derived by Yuen, Kennedy and Lax (YKL). MPE measurements have been found for states that form a single orbit under a group action, i.e., there is a transitive group action on the states in the set. For such state sets, termed geometrically uniform (GU) by Forney, it was shown that the `pretty good measurement' (PGM) attains the MPE. Even so, evaluating the actual probability of error (and other performance metrics) attained by the PGM on a GU set involves inverting large matrices, and is not easy in general. Our first contribution is a formula for the MPE and conditional probabilities of GU sets, using group representation theory. Next, we consider sets of pure states that have multiple orbits under the group action. Such states are termed compound geometrically uniform (CGU). MPE measurements for general CGU sets are not known. In this paper, we show how our representation-theoretic description of optimal measurements for GU sets naturally generalizes to the CGU case. We show how to compute the MPE measurement for CGU sets by reducing the problem to solving a few simultaneous equations. The number of equations depends on the sizes of the multiplicity space of irreducible representations. For many common group representations (such as those of several practical good linear codes), this is much more tractable than solving large semi-definite programs---which is what is needed to solve the YKL conditions numerically for arbitrary state sets. We show how to evaluate MPE measurements for CGU states for some examples relevant to quantum-limited classical optical communication.},

It is then desirable to infer their properties based solely on the interactions they have with systems over which we have control. In this spirit, here we introduce schemes for assessing the non-classicality of the inaccessible objects as characterised by quantum discord. We consider two probes individually interacting with the inaccessible object, but not with each other. The schemes are based on monitoring entanglement dynamics between the probes. Our method is robust and experimentally friendly as it allows the probes and the object to be open systems, makes no assumptions about the initial state, dimensionality of involved Hilbert spaces and details of the probe-object Hamiltonian. We apply our scheme to a membrane-in-the-middle optomechanical system, to detect system-environment correlations in open system dynamics as well as non-classicality of the environment, and we foresee potential benefits for the inference of the non-classical nature of gravity.},

It consists in finding measurement schemes that, according to some figure of merit, will determine the state of the system.

	Abstract = {Quantum hypothesis testing is one of the most basic tasks in quantum information theory and has fundamental links with quantum communication and estimation theory. In this paper, we establish a formula that characterizes the decay rate of the minimal Type-II error probability in a quantum hypothesis test of two Gaussian states given a fixed constraint on the Type-I error probability. This formula is a direct function of the mean vectors and covariance matrices of the quantum Gaussian states in question. We give an application to quantum illumination, which is the task of determining whether there is a low-reflectivity object embedded in a target region with a bright thermal-noise bath. For the asymmetric-error setting, we find that a quantum illumination transmitter can achieve an error probability exponent much stronger than a coherent-state transmitter of the same mean photon number, and furthermore, that it requires far fewer trials to do so. This occurs when the background thermal noise is either low or bright, which means that a quantum advantage is even easier to witness than in the symmetric-error setting because it occurs for a larger range of parameters. Going forward from here, we expect our formula to have applications in settings well beyond those considered in this paper, especially to quantum communication tasks involving quantum Gaussian channels.},

	Abstract = {We study the quantification of coherence in infinite dimensional systems, especially the infinite dimensional bosonic systems in Fock space. We show that given the energy constraints, the relative entropy of coherence serves as a well-defined quantification of coherence in infinite dimensional systems. Via using the relative entropy of coherence, we also generalize the problem to multi-mode Fock space and special examples are considered. It is shown that with a finite average particle number, increasing the number of modes of light can enhance the relative entropy of coherence. With the mean energy constraint, our results can also be extended to other infinite-dimensional systems. Quantum coherence arising from quantum superposition principle is a fundamental aspect of quantum physics [1]. The laser [2] and superfluidity [3] are examples of quantum co-herence, whose effects are evident at the macroscopic scale. However, the framework of quantification of coherence has only been methodically investigated recently. The first at-tempt to address the classification of quantum coherence as physical resources by T. Baumgratz et. al., who have estab-lished a rigorous framework for the quantification of coher-ence based on distance measures in finite dimensional set-ting [4]. With such a fundational framework for coherence, one can find the appropriate distance measures to quantify co-herence in a fixed basis by measuring the distance between the quantum stat{\^{e}} $\rho$ and its nearest incoherent state. After the framework for coherence has been proposed, it receives increasing attentions. A. Streltsov et. al. have used entangle-ment to quantify quantum coherence, which provides the op-erational quantification of coherence [8]. S. Du et. al. focused on the interconversion of coherent states by means of incoher-ent operations using the concept of majorization relations [7]. Z. Xi et. al. have given a clear quantitative analysis and op-erational connections between relative entropy of coherence, quantum discord and one-way quantum deficit in the bipartite quantum system [6]. T. Bromley et. al. have found freez-ing conditions in which coherence remains unchanged during the nonunitary dynamics [5]. Up to now, all the results for quantifying the quantum coherence are assumed the finite di-mensional setting, which is neither necessary nor desirable. In consideration of the relevant physical situations such as quan-tum optics states of light, it must require further investigations on infinite dimensional systems.},

	Abstract = {We interpret optical Gaussian pure states as systems of entangled spins using the Schwinger representation of SU(2). As these are continuous-variable systems, we are interested in the nullifiers for any given system in terms of Schwinger operators. Considering also a Schwinger representation of U(2) and generalising this to U(n) for n modes, we show that these nullifiers correspond to passive interferometric symmetries of the system. We present necessary and sufficient conditions that the adjacency matrix for a given Gaussian pure state and its corresponding nullifiers must satisfy. For the class of Gaussian pure states with bipartite graphs, we provide a method to derive the corresponding nullifiers. We derive the class of Gaussian pure states on two modes that is left invariant under an arbitrary passive interferometric operation and provide examples of these for some simple interferometers. We derive nullifiers for optical Gaussian pure states on two, four, and n modes. These nullifiers reveal information about the structure of the entangled Schwinger spins in the system, providing intuition to applying the Schwinger mapping to large, optical Gaussian states. These nullifiers also provide local, interferometric symmetries for the corresponding optical Gaussian systems. These symmetries could lend themselves to applications such as gate teleportation in continuous-variable systems, whereby the symmetry of the entangled resource enables specific gates to be teleported with minimal noise.},

	Abstract = {The entanglement-assisted classical capacity of a noisy quantum channel (CE) is the amount of information per channel use that can be sent over the channel in the limit of many uses of the channel, assuming that the sender and receiver have access to the resource of shared quantum entanglement, which may be used up by the communication protocol. We show that the capacity CE is given by an expression parallel to that for the capacity of a purely classical channel: i.e., the maximum, over channel inputs {\&}rho;, of the entropy of the channel input plus the entropy of the channel output minus their joint entropy, the latter being defined as the entropy of an entangled purification of {\&}rho; after half of it has passed through the channel. We calculate entanglement-assisted capacities for two interesting quantum channels, the qubit amplitude damping channel and the bosonic channel with amplification/attenuation and Gaussian noise. We discuss how many independent parameters are required to completely characterize the asymptotic behavior of a general quantum channel, alone or in the presence of ancillary resources such as prior entanglement. In the classical analog of entanglement-assisted communication - communication over a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) between parties who share prior random information - we show that one parameter is sufficient, i.e., that in the presence of prior shared random information, all DMCs of equal capacity can simulate one another with unit asymptotic efficiency.},

	Abstract = {Quantum state discrimination is a fundamental primitive in quantum statistics where one has to correctly identify the state of a system that is in one of two possible known states. A programmable discrimination machine performs this task when the pair of possible states is not a priori known but instead the two possible states are provided through two respective program ports. We study optimal programmable discrimination machines for general qubit states when several copies of states are available in the data or program ports. Two scenarios are considered: One in which the purity of the possible states is a priori known, and the fully universal one where the machine operates over generic mixed states of unknown purity. We find analytical results for both the unambiguous and minimum error discrimination strategies. This allows us to calculate the asymptotic performance of programmable discrimination machines when a large number of copies are provided and to recover the standard state discrimination and state comparison values as different limiting cases. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

Although it is possible to achieve maximum a posteriori (MAP) bit error rate (BER) performance for both code families and for short codeword lengths, we observe that (i) structured codes are easier to learn and (ii) the neural network is able to generalize to codewords that it has never seen during training for structured, but not for random codes. These results provide some evidence that neural networks can learn a form of decoding algorithm, rather than only a simple classifier.

	Abstract = {A pure-loss bosonic channel is a simple model for communication over free-space or fiber-optic links. More generally, phase-insensitive bosonic channels model other kinds of noise, such as thermalizing or amplifying processes. Recent work has established the classical capacity of all of these channels, and furthermore, it is now known that a strong converse theorem holds for the classical capacity of these channels under a particular photon-number constraint. The goal of the present paper is to initiate the study of second-order coding rates for these channels, by beginning with the simplest one, the pure-loss bosonic channel. In a second-order analysis of communication, one fixes the tolerable error probability and seeks to understand the back-off from capacity for a sufficiently large yet finite number of channel uses. We find a lower bound on the maximum achievable code size for the pure-loss bosonic channel, in terms of the known expression for its capacity and a quantity called channel dispersion. We accomplish this by proving a general ``one-shot'' coding theorem for channels with classical inputs and pure-state quantum outputs which reside in a separable Hilbert space. The theorem leads to an optimal second-order characterization when the channel output is finite-dimensional, and it remains an open question to determine whether the characterization is optimal for the pure-loss bosonic channel.},

For each of these two learning models we establish a polynomial relationship between the number of quantum or classical queries required for learning. These results contrast known results that show that testing black-box functions for various properties, as opposed to learning, can require exponentially more classical queries than quantum queries. We also show that, under a widely held computational hardness assumption (the intractability of factoring Blum integers), there is a class of Boolean functions which is polynomial-time learnable in the quantum version but not the classical version of each learning model. For the model of exact learning from membership queries, we establish a stronger separation by showing that if any one-way function exists, then there is a class ...},

The challenge is that of assisting the radio in intelligent adaptive learning and decision making, so that the diverse requirements of next-generation wireless networks can be satisfied. Machine learning is one of the most promising artificial intelligence tools, conceived to support smart radio terminals. Future smart 5G mobile terminals are expected to autonomously access the most meritorious spectral bands with the aid of sophisticated spectral efficiency learning and inference, in order to control the transmission power, while relying on energy efficiency learning/inference and simultaneously adjusting the transmission protocols with the aid of quality of service learning/inference. Hence we briefly review the rudimentary concepts of machine learning and propose their employment in the compelling applications of 5G networks, including cognitive radios, massive MIMOs, femto/small cells, heterogeneous networks, smart grid, energy harvesting, device-todevice communications, and so on. Our goal is to assist the readers in refining the motivation, problem formulation, and methodology of powerful machine learning algorithms in the context of future networks in order to tap into hitherto unexplored applications and services.},

Here we give an operational definition whereby phase is instead defined in terms of measurement statistics. Our definition is phrased in terms of the operational framework known as generalized probabilistic theories or the convex framework. The definition makes it possible to ask whether other theories in this framework can also have phase.We apply our definition to investigate phase and interference in several example theories: classical probability theory, a version of Spekkens' toy model, quantum theory and box-world.We find that phase is ubiquitous; any non-classical theory can be said to have non-trivial phase dynamics.},

Random coding has nonzero capacity only for f{\textgreater}0.81071; by analogy to the classical Shannon coding limit, this value had previously been conjectured to be a lower bound. We use the method introduced by Shor and Smolin of concatenating a nonrandom repetition (cat) code within a random code to obtain good codes. The cat code with block size five is shown to be optimal for single concatenation. The best known multiple-concatenated code we found has a block size of 25.

	Abstract = {One of the outstanding problems in non-equilibrium physics is to precisely understand when and how physically relevant observables in many-body systems equilibrate under unitary time evolution. While general equilibration results have been proven that show that equilibration is generic provided that the initial state has overlap with sufficiently many energy levels, at the same time results showing that natural initial states fulfill this condition are lacking. In this work, we present stringent results for equilibration for ergodic systems in which the amount of entanglement in energy eigenstates with finite energy density grows volume-like with the system size. Concretely, we carefully formalize notions of entanglement-ergodicity in terms of R$\backslash$'enyi entropies, from which we derive that such systems equilibrate exponentially well. Our proof uses insights about R$\backslash$'enyi entropies and combines them with recent results about the probability distribution of energy in lattice systems with initial states that are weakly correlated.},

Even so, coherent states can achieve the ultimate quantum limit for capacity of a classical channel, the Holevo capacity. Attaining this requires the receiver to make joint-detection measurements on long codeword blocks, optical implementations of which remain unknown. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of a joint-detection receiver, demodulating quaternary pulse-position-modulation codewords at a word error rate of up to 40{\%} (2.2 dB) below that attained with direct detection, the largest error-rate improvement over the standard quantum limit reported to date. This is accomplished with a conditional nulling receiver, which uses optimized-amplitude coherent pulse nulling, single photon detection and quantum feedforward. We further show how this translates into coding complexity improvements for practical pulse-position-modulation systems, such as in deep-space communication. We anticipate our experiment to motivate future work towards building Holevo-capacity-achieving joint-detection receivers.$\backslash$nView full text},

	Abstract = {Two quantum systems are identically prepared in different locations. An observer's task is to deter-mine their state. A simple example shows that a pair of measurements of the von Neumann type is less effective than a sequence of nonorthogonal probability-operator measures, alternating between the two quantum systems. However, the most efficient set of operations of that type that we were able to design falls short of a single combined measurement, performed on both systems together. PACS numbers: 03.65.Bz, 89.70.+c It is well known' that composite quantum systems, consisting of noninteracting parts, can possess nonlocal properties. In particular, a composite system can exhibit correlations which cannot be reproduced by any theoreti-cal model that involves only variables belonging to each subsystem separately. A typical example is a pair of spin----, ' particles produced by the decay of a spinless ob-ject. Their combined state, 2 'I ({\~{}}t J) --- {\~{}} J t)), cannot be reduced to a direct product by any transformation of the bases pertaining to each one of the particles. In this Letter, we consider a different kind of compos-ite system. Its parts never interacted in the past. They may have been prepared in different laboratories. How-ever, they were prepared according to the same set of in-structions. Therefore, these subsystems are in the same quantum state --- insofar as their internal variables are considered. For example, we may have two noninteract-ing spin-2 particles, prepared with the same polariza-tion. We consider in this Letter a particular example in which there are exactly three possible states for the two particles: Both spins may be directed along the z direc-tion, or both may be in the x-z plane, tilted at 120 or --- 120' from the z axis. (We have chosen this particular setup because the three possible states of each particle satisfy (tltt {\~{}} ttr2)(y2{\~{}} tlt3)(tlr3{\~{}} yt) = --- ---, ', and this is the most negative value obtainable for such a triple prod-uct.) We refer to the three special directions as the "sig-nal directions. " Suppose now that an outside observer wants to deter-mine which one of these three known preparations was actually implemented. The answer cannot be unambigu-ous, because the three states are not orthogonal. The ob-server may nevertheless assign probabilities to the vari-ous preparations. The problem thus is to design a mea-surement procedure which minimizes the unavoidable uncertainty of the result. The original purpose of our work was to determine whether more information could be obtained by means of an apparatus interacting with both particles together, than by separate measurements performed on each one of them individually. An exam-ple of a measurement of the former type --- which we will call a combined measurement --- is the one represented by the "entangled" operator in Eq. (3) below. Despite considerable efforts, we have not been able to obtain a complete answer to our question. Nevertheless, the results are intriguing. In particular, we have found a new measurement technique, acting on each particle sep-arately, which yields more information than any separate-particle method hitherto known. Our best stra-tegy of that type is, however, not as e{\%}cient as a well-chosen combined measurement. Thus our work suggests that one can indeed obtain more information by measur-ing the two particles together, but the results are not conclusive. We propose as a challenge to our fellow theorists either to find a better separate-particle strategy, as good as the combined measurement, or to prove that this aim is unattainable. To give a precise meaning to our problem, we need to quantify the notion of information gained from a mea-surement. We will use the standard measure of},

	Abstract = {Quantum coherence is an essential feature of quantum mechanics which is responsible for the departure between classical and quantum world. The recently established resource theory of quantum coherence studies possible quantum technological applications of quantum coherence, and limitations which arise if one is lacking the ability to establish superpositions. An important open problem in this context is a simple characterization for incoherent operations, constituted by all possible transformations allowed within the resource theory of coherence. In this work, we contribute to such a characterization by proving several upper bounds on the maximum number of incoherent Kraus operators in a general incoherent operation. For a single qubit, we show that the number of incoherent Kraus operators is not more than 5, and it remains an open question if this number can be reduced to 4. The presented results are also relevant for quantum thermodynamics, as we demonstrate by introducing the class of Gibbs-preserving strictly incoherent operations, and solving the corresponding mixed-state conversion problem for a single qubit.},

	Abstract = {Any physical process can be represented as a quantum channel mapping an initial state into a final state. Hence it can be characterized from the point of view of communication theory, i.e., in terms of its ability in transferring information. Quantum information provides the theoretical framework and the proper mathematical tools to accomplish this. In this context the notion of codes and communication capacities have been introduced by generalizing them from the classical Shannon theory of information transmission and error correction. The underlying assumption of this approach is to consider the channel not as acting on a single system, but on sequences of systems, which, when properly initialized allows one to overcome the noisy effects induced by the physical process under consideration. While most of the work produced so far have been focused on the case where a given channel transformation acts identically and independently on the various elements of the sequence (memoryless configuration in jargon), correlated error models appears to be a more realistic way to approach the problem. A slightly different, yet conceptually related, notion of correlated errors applies to a single quantum system which evolves continuously in time under the influence of an external disturbance which acts on it in a non-Markovian fashion. This leads to the study of memory effects in quantum channels: a fertile ground where interesting novel phenomena emerge at the intersection of quantum information theory with other branches of physics. We survey the field of quantum channels theory on a wide scenario that embraces also these specific and complex settings.},

	Abstract = {We establish the ultimate rates for transmitting quantum information, distilling entanglement, and distributing secret keys in repeater-assisted quantum communications, under the most fundamental decoherence models for both discrete and continuous variable systems, including lossy channels, quantum-limited amplifiers, dephasing and erasure channels. These capacities are derived considering the most general adaptive protocols for quantum and private communication between the two end-points of a repeater chain and, more generally, of an arbitrarily-complex quantum network or internet, where systems may be routed though single or multiple paths. Our methodology combines tools from quantum information and classical network theory. Converse results are derived by introducing a novel tensor-product representation for a quantum communication network, where quantum channels are replaced by their Choi matrices. Exploiting this representation and suitable entanglement cuts of the network, we upperbound the end-to-end capacities by means of the relative entropy of entanglement. Achievability of the bounds is proven by combining point-to-point quantum communications with classical network algorithms, so that optimal routing strategies are found by determining the widest path and the maximum flow in the network. In this way we extend both the widest path problem and the max-flow min-cut theorem from classical to quantum communications. Finally, we generalize our results to multiple senders and receivers in the quantum network, proving a quantum version of the network coding theorem for multi-end quantum key distribution.},

	Abstract = {Pattern recognition is a central topic in learning theory, with numerous applications such as voice and text recognition, image analysis and computer diagnosis. The statistical setup in classification is the following: we are given an i.i.d. training set (X 1, Y1),..., (X n, Yn), where Xi represents a feature and Yi ∈ {\{}0, 1{\}} is a label attached to that feature. The underlying joint distribution of (X, Y) is unknown, but we can learn about it from the training set, and we aim at devising low error classifiers f: X → Y used to predict the label of new incoming features. In this paper, we solve a quantum analogue of this problem, namely the classification of two arbitrary unknown mixed qubit states. Given a number of 'training' copies from each of the states, we would like to 'learn' about them by performing a measurement on the training set. The outcome is then used to design measurements for the classification of future systems with unknown labels. We found the asymptotically optimal classification strategy and show that typically it performs strictly better than a plug-in strategy, which consists of estimating the states separately and then discriminating between them using the Helstrom measurement. The figure of merit is given by the excess risk equal to the difference between the probability of error and the probability of error of the optimal measurement for known states. We show that the excess risk scales as n-1 and compute the exact constant of the rate. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

	Abstract = {We prove a generalization of the quantum de Finetti theorem when the local space is an infinite-dimensional Fock space. In particular, instead of considering the action of the permutation group on {\$}n{\$} copies of that space, we consider the action of the unitary group {\$}U(n){\$} on the creation operators of the {\$}n{\$} modes and define a natural generalization of the symmetric subspace as the space of states invariant under unitaries in {\$}U(n){\$}. Our first result is a complete characterization of this subspace, which turns out to be spanned by a family of generalized coherent states related to the special unitary group {\$}SU(p,q){\$} of signature {\$}(p,q){\$}. More precisely, this construction yields a unitary representation of the noncompact simple real Lie group {\$}SU(p,q){\$}. We therefore find a dual unitary representation of the pair of groups {\$}U(n){\$} and {\$}SU(p,q){\$} on an {\$}n(p+q){\$}-mode Fock space. The (Gaussian) {\$}SU(p,q){\$} coherent states resolve the identity on the symmetric subspace, which implies a Gaussian de Finetti theorem stating that tracing over a few modes of a unitary-invariant state yields a state close to a mixture of Gaussian states. As an application of this de Finetti theorem, we show that the {\$}n\backslashtimes n{\$} upper-left submatrix of an {\$}n\backslashtimes n{\$} Haar-invariant unitary matrix is close in total variation distance to a matrix of independent normal variables if {\$}n{\^{}}3 =O(m){\$}.},

We show that for the ternary signals, the receiver shows a reasonable gain from the SQL even without feedforward. This scheme is realizable with the currently available technology. For the quaternary signals feedforward operation is crucial to overcome the SQL with imperfect devices.

Here we review recent progress in theory and experiment related to such quantum input-output networks, with a focus on the SLH framework, a powerful modeling framework for networked quantum systems that is naturally endowed with properties such as modularity and hierarchy. We begin by explaining the physical approximations required to represent any individual node of a network, eg. atoms in cavity or a mechanical oscillator, and its coupling to quantum fields by an operator triple {\$}(S,L,H){\$}. Then we explain how these nodes can be composed into a network with arbitrary connectivity, including coherent feedback channels, using algebraic rules, and how to derive the dynamics of network components and output fields. The second part of the review discusses several extensions to the basic SLH framework that expand its modeling capabilities, and the prospects for modeling integrated implementations of quantum input-output networks. In addition to summarizing major results and recent literature, we discuss the potential applications and limitations of the SLH framework and quantum input-output networks, with the intention of providing context to a reader unfamiliar with the field.},

Two distant parties can increase the amount of entanglement between them by means of quantum communication encoded in a carrier that is sent from one party to the other. Intriguingly, entanglement can be increased even when the exchanged carrier is not entangled with the parties. However, in light of the defining property of entanglement stating that it cannot increase under classical communication, the carrier must be quantum. Here we show that, in general, the increase of relative entropy of entanglement between two remote parties is bounded by the amount of nonclassical correlations of the carrier with the parties as quantified by the relative entropy of discord. We study implications of this bound, provide new examples of entanglement distribution via unentangled states, and put further limits on this phenomenon.},

In full generality, the measurement can be performed a number {\$}n{\$} of times, and arbitrary pre-processing of the states and post-processing of the obtained data is allowed. Even if the two hypothesis correspond to orthogonal states, perfect discrimination is not always possible. There is thus an intrinsic error associated to the measurement device, which we aim to quantify, that limits its discrimination power. We minimize various error probabilities (averaged or constrained) over all pairs of {\$}n{\$}-partite input states. These probabilities, or their exponential rates of decrease in the case of large {\$}n{\$}, give measures of the discrimination power of the device. For the asymptotic rate of the averaged error probability, we obtain a Chernoff-type bound, dual to the standard Chernoff bound for which the state pair is fixed and the optimization is over all measurements. The key point in the derivation is that i.i.d. states become optimal in asymptotic settings. Minimum asymptotic rates are also obtained for constrained error probabilities, dual to Stein's Lemma and Hoeffding's bound. We further show that adaptive protocols where the state preparer gets feedback from the measurer do not improve the asymptotic rates. These rates thus quantify the ultimate discrimination power of a measurement device.},

@article{Gambetta2007,
	Abstract = {We study how the spontaneous relaxation of a qubit affects a continuous quantum non-demolition measurement of the initial state of the qubit. Given some noisy measurement record {\$}\backslashPsi{\$}, we seek an estimate of whether the qubit was initially in the ground or excited state. We investigate four different measurement protocols, three of which use a linear filter (with different weighting factors) and a fourth which uses a full non-linear filter that gives the theoretically optimal estimate of the initial state of the qubit. We find that relaxation of the qubit at rate {\$}1/T{\_}1{\$} strongly influences the fidelity of any measurement protocol. To avoid errors due to this decay, the measurement must be completed in a time that decrease linearly with the desired fidelity while maintaining an adequate signal to noise ratio. We find that for the non-linear filter the predicted fidelity, as expected, is always better than the linear filters and that the fidelity is a monotone increasing function of the measurement time. For example, to achieve a fidelity of 90{\%}, the box car linear filter requires a signal to noise ratio of {\$}\backslashsim 30{\$} in a time {\$}T{\_}1{\$} whereas the non-linear filter only requires a signal to noise ratio of {\$}\backslashsim 18{\$}.},

	Abstract = {Manipulation and quantification of quantum resources are fundamental problems in quantum physics. In the asymptotic limit, coherence distillation and dilution have been proposed by manipulating infinite identical copies of states. In the non-asymptotic setting, finite data-size effects emerge, and the practically relevant problem of coherence manipulation using finite resources has been left open. This letter establishes the one-shot theory of coherence dilution, which involves converting maximally coherent states into an arbitrary quantum state using maximally incoherent operations, dephasing-covariant incoherent operations, incoherent operations, or strictly incoherent operations. We introduce several coherence monotones with concrete operational interpretations that estimate the one-shot coherence cost --- the minimum amount of maximally coherent states needed for faithful coherence dilution. Furthermore, we derive the asymptotic coherence dilution results with maximally incoherent operations, incoherent operations, and strictly incoherent operations as special cases. Our result can be applied in the analyses of quantum information processing tasks that exploit coherence as resources, such as quantum key distribution and random number generation.},

To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolutional operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers, we employed a recently-developed method called 'dropout' that proved to be effective.

The proposed learning theory has the following abilities: 1) to utilize the qualities of each learned representation on the path from raw inputs to outputs in representation learning, 2) to guarantee good generalization errors possibly with arbitrarily rich hypothesis spaces (e.g., arbitrarily large capacity and Rademacher complexity) and non-stable/non-robust learning algorithms, and 3) to clearly distinguish each individual problem instance from each other. Our generalization bounds are relative to a representation of the data, and hold true even if the representation is learned. We discuss several consequences of our results on deep learning, one-shot learning and curriculum learning. Unlike statistical learning theory, the proposed learning theory analyzes each problem instance individually via measure theory, rather than a set of problem instances via statistics. Because of the differences in the assumptions and the objectives, the proposed learning theory is meant to be complementary to previous learning theory and is not designed to compete with it.},

The quantum kernel can be tailored systematically with a quantum circuit to raise the kernel to an arbitrary power and to assign arbitrary weights to each training data. Given a specific input state, our protocol calculates the weighted power sum of fidelities of quantum data in quantum parallel via a swap-test circuit followed by two single-qubit measurements, requiring only a constant number of repetitions regardless of the number of data. We also show that our classifier is equivalent to measuring the expectation value of a Helstrom operator, from which the well-known optimal quantum state discrimination can be derived.

Quantum information protocols can further enhance the performance in data transmission by encoding a message in quantum states, however, most proposals to date have focused on the regime of a large number of uses of the noisy channel, which is unfeasible with current quantum technology. We experimentally demonstrate quantum enhanced communication over an amplitude damping noisy channel with only two uses of the channel per bit and a single entangling gate at the decoder. By simulating the channel using a photonic interferometric setup, we experimentally increase the reliability of transmitting a data bit by greater than 20{\%} for a certain damping range over classically sending the message twice. We show how our methodology can be extended to larger systems by simulating the transmission of a single bit with up to eight uses of the channel and a two-bit message with three uses of the channel, predicting a quantum enhancement in all cases.},

	Abstract = {In order to analyze non-Markovianity of tripartite quantum states from a resource theoretical viewpoint, we introduce a class of quantum operations performed by three distant parties, and investigate an operational resource theory (ORT) induced it. A tripartite state is a free state if and only if it is a quantum Markov chain. We prove monotonicity of functions such as the conditional quantum mutual information, intrinsic information, squashed entanglement, a generalization of entanglement of purification, and the relative entropy of recovery. The ORT has five bound sets, each of which corresponds to one of the monotone functions. We introduce a task of "non-Markovianity dilution", and prove that the optimal rate for the task, namely the "non-Markovianity cost", is bounded from above by entanglement of purification in the case of pure states. We also propose a classical resource theory of non-Markovianity.},

	Abstract = {Distinguishing assigned quantum states with assigned probabilities via quantum measurements is a crucial problem for the transmission of classical information through quantum channels. Measurement operators maximizing the probability of correct discrimination have been characterized by Helstrom, Holevo and Yuen since 1970's. On the other hand, closed--form solutions are available only for particular situations enjoying high degrees of symmetry. As a suboptimal solution to the problem, measurement operators, directly determined from states and probabilities and known as square root measurements (SRM), were introduced by Hausladen and Wootters. These operators were also recognized to be optimal for pure states equipped with geometrical uniform symmetry (GUS). In this paper we discuss the optimality of the SRM and find necessary and sufficient conditions in order that SRM maximize the correct decision probabilities for set of states formed by several constellations of GUS states. The results are applied to some specific examples concerning double constellations of quantum phase shift keying (PSK) and pulse position modulation (PPM) states, with possible applications to practical systems of quantum communications.},

In recent work, we showed a receiver for a pure-state channel that can attain the ultimate capacity by applying a single-shot optical (unitary) transformation on the received codeword state followed by simultaneous (but separable) projective measurements on the single-modulation-symbol state spaces. In this paper, we study the ultimate tradeoff between photon efficiency and spectral efficiency for the FSO channel. Based on our general results for the pure-state quantum channel, we show some of the first concrete examples of codes and laboratory-realizable joint-detection optical receivers that can achieve fundamentally higher (superadditive) channel capacity than receivers that physically detect each modulation symbol one at a time, as is done by all conventional (coherent or direct-detection) optical receivers.},

	Abstract = {Determining the state of a quantum system is a consuming procedure. For this reason, whenever one is interested only in some particular property of a state, it would be desirable to design a measurement setup that reveals this property with as little effort as possible. Here we investigate whether, in order to successfully complete a given task of this kind, one needs an informationally complete measurement, or if something less demanding would suffice. The first alternative means that in order to complete the task, one needs a measurement which fully determines the state. We formulate the task as a membership problem related to a partitioning of the quantum state space and, in doing so, connect it to the geometry of the state space. For a general membership problem we prove various sufficient criteria that force informational completeness, and we explicitly treat several physically relevant examples. For the specific cases that do not require informational completeness, we also determine bounds on the minimal number of measurement outcomes needed to ensure success in the task.},

	Abstract = {Encoding quantum information in the photon temporal mode (TM) offers a robust platform for high-dimensional quantum protocols. The main practical challenge, however, is to design a device that operates on single photons in specific TMs and all coherent superpositions. The quantum pulse gate (QPG) is a mode-selective sum-frequency generation designed for this task. Here, we perform a full modal characterisation of a QPG using weak coherent states in well-defined TMs. We reconstruct a full set of measurement operators, which show an average fidelity of 0.85 to a theoretically ideal device when operating on a 7-dimensional space. Then we use these characterised measurement operators of the QPG to calibrate the device. Using the calibrated device and a tomographically complete set of measurements, we show that the QPG can perform high-dimensional TM state tomography with 0.99 fidelity.},

@techreport{Egorov2015,
	Abstract = {Learning an effective representation for high-dimensional data is a challenging problem in reinforcement learning (RL). Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) such as Deep Q networks (DQN) achieves remarkable success in computer games by learning deeply encoded representation from convolution networks. In this paper, we propose a simple yet very effective method for representation learning with DRL algorithms. Our key insight is that features learned by DRL algorithms are highly correlated, which interferes with learning. By adding a regularized loss that penalizes correlation in latent features (with only slight computation), we decorrelate features represented by deep neural networks incrementally. On 49 Atari games, with the same regularization factor, our decorrelation algorithms perform {\$}70\backslash{\%}{\$} in terms of human-normalized scores, which is {\$}40\backslash{\%}{\$} better than DQN. In particular, ours performs better than DQN on 39 games with 4 close ties and lost only slightly on {\$}6{\$} games. Empirical results also show that the decorrelation method applies to Quantile Regression DQN (QR-DQN) and significantly boosts performance. Further experiments on the losing games show that our decorelation algorithms can win over DQN and QR-DQN with a fined tuned regularization factor.},

	Abstract = {We present a general framework to tackle the problem of finding time-independent dynamics generating target unitary evolutions. We show that this problem is equivalently stated as a set of conditions over the spectrum of the time-independent gate generator, thus transforming the task to an inverse eigenvalue problem. We illustrate our methodology by identifying suitable time-independent generators implementing Toffoli and Fredkin gates without the need for ancillae or effective evolutions. We show how the same conditions can be used to solve the problem numerically, via supervised learning techniques. In turn, this allows us to solve problems that are not amenable, in general, to direct analytical solution, providing at the same time a high degree of flexibility over the types of gate-design problems that can be approached. As a significant example, we find generators for the Toffoli gate using only diagonal pairwise interactions, which are easier to implement in some experimental architectures. To showcase the flexibility of the supervised learning approach, we give an example of a nontrivial four-qubit gate that is implementable using only diagonal, pairwise interactions.},

	Abstract = {A striking feature of quantum error correcting codes is that they can sometimes be used to correct more errors than they can uniquely identify. Such degenerate codes have long been known, but have remained poorly understood. We provide a heuristic for designing degenerate quantum codes for high noise rates, which is applied to generate codes that can be used to communicate over almost any Pauli channel at rates that are impossible for a nondegenerate code. The gap between nondegenerate and degenerate code performance is quite large, in contrast to the tiny magnitude of the only previous demonstration of this effect. We also identify a channel for which none of our codes outperform the best nondegenerate code and show that it is nevertheless quite unlike any channel for which nondegenerate codes are known to be optimal.},

	Abstract = {We present a theoretical study of minimum error probability discrimination, using quantum- optical probe states, of M optical phase shifts situated symmetrically on the unit circle. We assume ideal lossless conditions and full freedom for implementing quantum measurements and for probe state selection, subject only to a constraint on the average energy, i.e., photon number. In particular, the probe state is allowed to have any number of signal and ancillary modes, and to be pure or mixed. Our results are based on a simple criterion that partitions the set of pure probe states into equivalence classes with the same error probability performance. Under an energy constraint, we find the explicit form of the state that minimizes the error probability. This state is an unentangled but nonclassical single-mode state. The error performance of the optimal state is compared with several standard states in quantum optics. We also show that discrimination with zero error is possible only beyond a threshold energy of (M - 1)/2. For the M = 2 case, we show that the optimum performance is readily demonstrable with current technology. While transmission loss and detector inefficiencies lead to a nonzero erasure probability, the error rate conditional on no erasure is shown to remain the same as the optimal lossless error rate.},

@article{guhaOpQuantum,
	Abstract = {Laser light is widely used for communication and sensing applications, so the optimal discrimination of coherent states---the quantum states of light emitted by an ideal laser---has immense practical importance. Due to fundamental limits imposed by quantum mechanics, such discrimination has a finite minimum probability of error. While concrete optical circuits for the optimal discrimination between two coherent states are well known, the generalization to larger sets of coherent states has been challenging. In this paper, we show how to achieve optimal discrimination of any set of coherent states using a resource-efficient quantum computer. Our construction leverages a recent result on discriminating multicopy quantum hypotheses [Blume-Kohout, Croke, and Zwolak, arXiv:1201.6625]. As illustrative examples, we analyze the performance of discriminating a ternary alphabet and showhowthe quantum circuit of a receiver designed to discriminate a binary alphabet can be reused in discriminating multimode hypotheses. Finally, we show that our result can be used to achieve the quantum limit on the rate of classical information transmission on a lossy optical channel, which is known to exceed the Shannon rate of all conventional optical receivers.

This behavior can often exhibit dramatic properties such as phase transitions, as well as power law asymptotics not explained by the VC theory. The disadvantages of our theory are that its application requires knowledge of the input distribution, and it is limited so far to finite cardinality function classes.

@book{Holevo2011,
	Abstract = {The mathematical language of modern quantum mechanics is operator theory. Operators play there a role similar to functions in classical me- chanics, probability theory and statistics. However, while the use of func- tions in classical theories is founded on premises which seem intuitively quite clear, in quantum theory the situation with operators is different. Historically the ``matrix mechanics'' of Heisenberg and the ``wave mechanics'' of Schr¨odinger which gave rise to the contemporary form of quantum theory, originated from ingenious attempts to t mathemat- ical objects able to reect some unusual (from the macroscopic point of view) features of microparticle behavior -- in particular, a peculiar combination of continuous and discrete properties. The ``probabilistic interpretation'' developed later by Born and others elucidated the mean- ing of operator formalism by postulating rules connecting mathematical objects with observable quantities. However a good deal of arbitrari- ness remained in these postulates and the most convincing argument for quantum-theoretical explanations was still the ``striking'' coincidence of theoretical predictions with experimental data. This state of affairs gave rise to numerous attempts, on one hand, to nd classical alternatives to quantum theory which would give an equally satisfactory description of the experimental data, and on the other hand, to nd out physical and philosophical arguments for justifying the inevitability of the new me- chanics. Notwithstanding the impressive philosophical achievements in this eld there was and still is a need for the structural investigation of quan- tum theory from a more mathematical point of view aimed at elucidating the connections between the entities of the physical world and the ele- ments of operator formalism. The present book is essentially in this line of research opened by the classical von Neumann's treatise ``Mathemati- cal Foundations of Quantum Mechanics''. However it differs from most subsequent investigations by the strong emphasis on the statistical rather than ``logical'' essence of quantum theory; it gives an account of recentxiv Alexander Holevo progress in the statistical theory of quantum measurement, stimulated by the new applications of quantum mechanics, particularly in quantum op- tics. The rst three chapters give an introduction to the foundations of quan- tum mechanics, addressed to the reader interested in the structure of quantum theory and its relations with classical probability. In spite of the mathematical character of the presentation it is not ``axiomatic''. Its purpose is to display the origin of the basic elements of operator formal- ism resting, as far as possible, upon the classical probabilistic concepts. The present revision is not an end in itself -- it emerged from the so- lution of concrete problems concerning the quantum limitations to mea- surement accuracy, arising in applications. So far there has been no gen- eral approach to such kind of problems. The methods of mathemati- cal statistics adapted for classical measurements required radial quantum modication. The last chapters of the book are devoted to the recently developed quantum estimation theory, which is an analog of the corre- sponding branch of mathematical statistics. We now give a more detailed account of the contents of the book. In Chapter 1 the general concepts of state and measurement are introduced on the basis of statistical analysis of an experimental situation. From the very beginning this approach leads to a substantial generalization of the Dirac-von Neumann concept of an observable. Mathematically it is re- ected by the occurrence of arbitrary resolutions of identity in place of or- thogonal ones (spectral measures) and the repudiation of self-adjointness as an indispensable attribute of an observable. In this way nonorthog- onal resolutions of identity like the ``overcomplete'' system of coherent states known in physics for rather a long time nd their proper place in quantum phenomenology. The new concept of quantum measurement is central for the whole book. The notion of statistical model exploited in Chapter 1 is quite general and may nd applications different from quantum theory. It gives us a new insight into the still controversial ``hidden variables'' problem. In Chapter 2 the elements of operator theory in Hilbert space are intro- duced to provide mathematical background for the subsequent material. As compared to standard presentations relatively much attention is paid to nonorthogonal resolutions of identity and related questions. A novel feature is also the introduction of the L 2 spaces of observables associ- ated with a quantum state and playing a role similar to the Hilbert space of random variables with nite second moment in probability theory. These L 2 spaces give the framework for a calculus of unbounded operators. Of fundamental importance to quantum theory are groups of symme- tries. In Chapter 3 elementary quantum mechanics is considered from thisxv Probabilistic and Statistical Aspects of Quantum Theory point of view. An important result of this discussion is the isolation of the notion of covariant measurement which ties physical quantities with cer- tain classes of resolutions of identity in the underlying Hilbert space. In this way we construct quantum measurements canonically corresponding to such quantities as time, phase of harmonic oscillator, angle of rotation and joint measurement of coordinate and velocity. Allowing the broader concept of quantum measurement enables us to resolve old troubles of quantum theory connected with the non-existence of self-adjoint opera- tors having the required covariance properties. Chapter 4 is devoted to a more advanced study of covariant measure- ments and extreme quantum limits for the accuracy of estimation of phys- ical parameters. The latter problem becomes important in view of the progress in experimental physics. We present a unied statistical ap- proach to ``non-standard'' uncertainty relations of the ``angle-angular mo- mentum'' type. They appear to be related to the quantum analog of the Hunt-Stein theorem in mathematical statistics. A general conclusion which can be drawn from Chapter 4 is that the requirements of covariance and optimality, i.e., extremal quantum accuracy, determine the canoni- cal measurement of a ``shift'' parameter, such as angle, coordinate, time, uniquely up to a ``gauge'' transformation. An example of a situation where quantum limitations are important is provided by optical communication. As it is known, ``quantum noise'' dis- torting the signal in the optical range can be much more signicant than the thermal background radiation. As in ordinary communication theory the problem of signal estimation arises, but now it requires a specically quantum-theoretic formulation and solution. Chapter 5 is devoted to the so-called Gaussian states which, in par- ticular, describe radiation elds in optical communication theory. The presentation is intended to make maximal use of the remarkable parallel with the Gaussian probability distributions. An important role is played here by quantum characteristic functions. In Chapter 6 the general inequalities for the measurement mean square errors are derived, which are quantum analogs of the well-known Cramer- Rao inequality in mathematical statistics. The best unbiased measure- ments of the mean-value parameters of a Gaussian state are describ- ed. Needless to say, the present book cannot (and is not intended to) re- place the standard textbooks on quantum mechanics. Most of the impor- tant topics, such as perturbation theory, are apparently out of its scope. Nor does it pretend to give a full account of quantum measurements. We have discussed only those problems which concern measurement statis- tics and do not require consideration of state changes after measurements.The references to the relevant work on ``open'' quantum systems and quantum stochastic processes can be found in the comments. The author's intention was to write a book accessible to a wide circle of readers, both mathematicians and physicists. As a result, the presenta- tion, being in general mathematical, is rather informal and certainly not ``the most economic'' from a mathematical point of view. On the other hand, it neglects some subtleties concerning measurability etc. As a rule a rigorous treatment can be found in the special papers refered to. The necessary background for the whole material is knowledge of fundamen- tals of probability theory. Mathematically the most elementary is Chapter 1 which uses mainly nite-dimensional linear analysis. The functional analytic minimum is given in Section 2.1-2.6 of Chapter 2, and a math- ematically educated reader may just glance over it. On the other hand, a reader familiar with quantum mechanics can omit the detailed discussion of such topics as harmonic oscillators and spin in Chapter 3, included to make the presentation self-contained, and concentrate on less familiar things. The Dirac notation is used intensively throughout the book but with round brackets for the inner product as accepted in mathematical litera- ture. The angle brackets, associated with the averaging symbol in statis- tical mechanics, are reserved for the different inner product dening the correlation of a pair of observables. To denote a quantum state as well as its density operator we use the letter S (not the usual $\rho$ ) allied to the notation P for the classical state (probability distribution).

These methods are specialized for quantum states that are fairly pure, and they offer a significant performance improvement on large quantum systems. In particular, they are able to reconstruct an unknown density matrix of dimension d and rank r using O(rd log{\^{}}2 d) measurement settings, compared to standard methods that require d{\^{}}2 settings. Our methods have several features that make them amenable to experimental implementation: they require only simple Pauli measurements, use fast convex optimization, are stable against noise, and can be applied to states that are only approximately low-rank. The acquired data can be used to certify that the state is indeed close to pure, so no a priori assumptions are needed. We present both theoretical bounds and numerical simulations.},

In this letter we propose a unitary quantum simulator for discrete-time stochastic processes which requires less internal memory than any classical analogue throughout the simulation. The simulator's internal memory requirements equal those of the best previous quantum models. However, in contrast to previous models it only requires a (small) finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Moreover, since the simulator operates unitarily throughout, it avoids any unnecessary information loss. We provide a step-wise construction for simulators for a large class of stochastic processes hence directly opening the possibility for experimental implementations with current platforms for quantum computation.

However, in its broader formulation, the quantum Zeno effect does not necessarily freeze everything. On the contrary, for frequent projections onto a multidimensional subspace, the system can evolve away from its initial state, although it remains in the subspace defined by the measurement. The continuing time evolution within the projected "quantum Zeno subspace" is called "quantum Zeno dynamics:" for instance, if the measurements ascertain whether a quantum particle is in a given spatial region, the evolution is unitary and the generator of the Zeno dynamics is the Hamiltonian with hard-wall (Dirichlet) boundary conditions. We discuss the physical and mathematical aspects of this evolution, highlighting the open mathematical problems. We then analyze some alternative strategies to obtain a Zeno dynamics and show that they are physically equivalent.},

	Abstract = {This paper contains several new results concerning covariant quantum channels in d {\textgreater}= 2 dimensions. The first part, Sec. 3, based on [4], is devoted to unitarily covariant channels, namely depolarizing and transpose-depolarizing channels. The second part, Sec. 4, based on [10], studies Weyl-covariant channels. These results are preceded by Sec. 2 in which we discuss various representations of general completely positive maps and channels. In the first part of the paper we compute complementary channels for depolarizing and transpose-depolarizing channels. This method easily yields minimal Kraus representations from non-minimal ones. We also study properties of the output purity of the tensor product of a channel and its complementary. In the second part, the formalism of discrete noncommutative Fourier transform is developed and applied to the study of Weyl-covariant maps and channels. We then extend a result in [16] concerning a bound for the maximal output 2-norm of a Weyl-covariant channel. A class of maps which attain the bound is introduced, for which the multiplicativity of the maximal output 2-norm is proven. The complementary channels are described which have the same multiplicativity properties as the Weyl-covariant channels.},

	Abstract = {Classifying phases of matter is key to our understanding of many problems in physics. For quantum-mechanical systems in particular, the task can be daunting due to the exponentially large Hilbert space. With modern computing power and access to ever-larger data sets, classification problems are now routinely solved using machine-learning techniques. Here, we propose a neural-network approach to finding phase transitions, based on the performance of a neural network after it is trained with data that are deliberately labelled incorrectly. We demonstrate the success of this method on the topological phase transition in the Kitaev chain, the thermal phase transition in the classical Ising model, and the many-body-localization transition in a disordered quantum spin chain. Our method does not depend on order parameters, knowledge of the topological content of the phases, or any other specifics of the transition at hand. It therefore paves the way to the development of a generic tool for identifying unexplored phase transitions.},

	Abstract = {A strong converse theorem for the classical capacity of a quantum channel states that the probability of correctly decoding a classical message converges exponentially fast to zero in the limit of many channel uses if the rate of communication exceeds the classical capacity of the channel. Along with a corresponding achievability statement for rates below the capacity, such a strong converse theorem enhances our understanding of the capacity as a very sharp dividing line between achievable and unachievable rates of communication. Here, we show that such a strong converse theorem holds for the classical capacity of all entanglement-breaking channels and all Hadamard channels (the complementary channels of the former). These results follow by bounding the success probability in terms of a "sandwiched" Renyi relative entropy, by showing that this quantity is subadditive for all entanglement-breaking and Hadamard channels, and by relating this quantity to the Holevo capacity. Prior results regarding strong converse theorems for particular covariant channels emerge as a special case of our results.},

For quantum erasure channels, we observe that high quantum data rates can be achieved for block error rates less than 10{\^{}}(-4) and that somewhat lower quantum data rates can be achieved for quantum depolarizing and BB84 channels. Our results here also serve as bounds for and simulations of private classical data transmission over these channels, essentially due to Renes' duality bounds for privacy amplification and classical data transmission of complementary observables. Future work might be able to improve upon our numerical results for quantum depolarizing and BB84 channels by employing a polar coding rule other than the heuristic used here.},

We show that by employing hashing, a deterministic entanglement distillation protocol with one-way communication, one obtains a scalable scheme that allows one to reach arbitrary distances, with constant overhead in resources per repeater station, and ultrahigh rates. In practical terms, we show that also with moderate resources of a few hundred qubits at each repeater station, one can reach intercontinental distances. At the same time, a measurement-based implementation allows one to tolerate high loss, but also operational and memory errors of the order of several percent per qubit. This opens the way for long-distance communication of big quantum data.},

As is well known, it is generically possible in a quantum channel that the transmittable information in block coding of length n can exceed n times the maximum amount that can be sent without any coding scheme. This so-called superadditivity in classical capacity of a quantum channel is a distinct feature that cannot be found in a classical memoryless channel. In this paper, a practical model of channel coding that shows this property is presented. It consists of a simple code-word selection and the optimum decoding of the code words minimizing the average error probability. At first, optimization of decoding strategy is discussed. Then the channel coding that shows the superadditivity in classical capacity is demonstrated.},

We analyze the capacity of the lossy-noisy optical channel when the transmitter uses coherent state modulation but the receiver is restricted to a general quantum-limited Gaussian receiver, i.e., one that may involve arbitrary combinations of Gaussian operations (passive linear optics: beamsplitters and phase-shifters, second order nonlinear optics (or active linear optics): squeezers, along with homodyne or heterodyne detection measurements) and any amount of classical feedforward within the receiver. Under these assumptions, we show that the Gaussian receiver that attains the maximum mutual information is either homodyne detection, heterodyne detection, or time sharing between the two, depending upon the received power level. In other words, our result shows that to exceed the theoretical limit of conventional coherent optical communications, one has to incorporate non-Gaussian, i.e., third or higher-order nonlinear operations in the receiver. Finally we compare our Gaussian receiver limit with experimentally feasible non-Gaussian receivers and show that in the regime of low received photon flux, it is possible to overcome the Gaussian receiver limit by relatively simple non-Gaussian receivers based on photon counting.},

An emphasis is made on recent results, such as general quantum coding theorems including cases of infinite (possibly continuous) alphabets and constrained inputs, reliability function for pure state channels and quantum Gaussian channel. Several still unsolved problems are briefly outlined.},

	Abstract = {The experimental realization of increasingly complex synthetic quantum systems calls for the development of general theoretical methods to validate and fully exploit quantum resources. Quantum state tomography (QST) aims to reconstruct the full quantum state from simple measurements, and therefore provides a key tool to obtain reliable analytics1--3. However, exact brute-force approaches to QST place a high demand on computational resources, making them unfeasible for anything except small systems4,5. Here we show how machine learning techniques can be used to perform QST of highly entangled states with more than a hundred qubits, to a high degree of accuracy. We demonstrate that machine learning allows one to reconstruct traditionally challenging many-body quantities---such as the entanglement entropy---from simple, experimentally accessible measurements. This approach can benefit existing and future generations of devices ranging from quantum computers to ultracold-atom quantum simulators6--8.},

The neural network, which has 60 million paramters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolutional operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers, we employed a recently-developed method called 'dropout' that proved to be effective. We also entered a variant of the model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achievd a top-5 test error rate of 15.3{\%}, compared to 26.2{\%} achieved by the second-best entry.},

	Abstract = {Quantum key distribution using weak coherent states and homodyne detection is a promising candidate for practical quantum-cryptographic implementations due to its compatibility with existing telecom equipment and high detection efficiencies. However, despite the actual simplicity of the protocol, the security analysis of this method is rather involved compared to discrete-variable QKD. In this article we review the theoretical foundations of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) with Gaussian modulation and rederive the essential relations from scratch in a pedagogical way. The aim of this paper is to be as comprehensive and self-contained as possible in order to be well intelligible even for readers with little pre-knowledge on the subject. Although the present article is a theoretical discussion of CV-QKD, its focus lies on practical implementations, taking into account various kinds of hardware imperfections and suggesting practical methods to perform the security analysis subsequent to the key exchange. Apart from a review of well known results, this manuscript presents a set of new original noise models which are helpful to get an estimate of how well a given set of hardware will perform in practice.},

	Abstract = {Quantum states may exhibit asymmetry with respect to the action of a given group. Such an asymmetry of states can be considered as a resource in applications such as quantum metrology, and it is a concept that encompasses quantum coherence as a special case. We introduce explicitly and study the robustness of asymmetry, a quantifier of asymmetry of states that we prove to have many attractive properties, including efficient numerical computability via semidefinite programming, and an operational interpretation in a channel discrimination context. We also introduce the notion of asymmetry witnesses, whose measurement in a laboratory detects the presence of asymmetry. We prove that properly constrained asymmetry witnesses provide lower bounds to the robustness of asymmetry, which is shown to be a directly measurable quantity itself. We then focus our attention on coherence witnesses and the robustness of coherence, for which we prove a number of additional results; these include an analysis of its specific relevance in phase discrimination and quantum metrology, an analytical calculation of its value for a relevant class of quantum states, and tight bounds that relate it to another previously defined coherence monotone.},

We consider sets of states which satisfy a few natural properties, the most important being the closedness under permutations of the copies. We then determine the error rate function in a very similar fashion to quantum Stein's Lemma, in terms of the quantum relative entropy. Our result has two applications to entanglement theory. First it gives an operational meaning to an entanglement measure known as regularized relative entropy of entanglement. Second, it shows that this measure is faithful, being strictly positive on every entangled state. This implies, in particular, that whenever a multipartite state can be asymptotically converted into another entangled state by local operations and classical communication, the rate of conversion must be non-zero. Therefore, the operational definition of multipartite entanglement is equivalent to its mathematical definition.},

Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied, including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described},

We argue that the gain of entanglement assistance C ea / C {\textgreater} 1 generically for measurement channels with unsharp observables; in particular for the measurements with pure posterior states the information loss in the entanglement-assisted protocol is zero, resulting in an arbitrarily large gain for very noisy or weak signal channels. This is illustrated by examples of continuous observables corresponding to state tomography in finite dimensions and heterodyne measurement. In contrast, state preparations are characterized by the property of having no gain of entanglement assistance, C ea / C = 1.},

@article{Glasser2018,
	Abstract = {Tensor networks have found a wide use in a variety of applications in physics and computer science, recently leading to both theoretical insights as well as practical algorithms in machine learning. In this work we explore the connection between tensor networks and probabilistic graphical models, and show that it motivates the definition of generalized tensor networks where information from a tensor can be copied and reused in other parts of the network. We discuss the relationship between generalized tensor network architectures used in quantum physics, such as String-Bond States and Entangled Plaquette States, and architectures commonly used in machine learning. We provide an algorithm to train these networks in a supervised learning context and show that they overcome the limitations of regular tensor networks in higher dimensions, while keeping the computation efficient. A method to combine neural networks and tensor networks as part of a common deep learning architecture is also introduced. We benchmark our algorithm for several generalized tensor network architectures on the task of classifying images and sounds, and show that they outperform previously introduced tensor network algorithms. Some of the models we consider can be realized on a quantum computer and may guide the development of near-term quantum machine learning architectures.},

@article{Cohen2015,
	Abstract = {It has long been conjectured that hypotheses spaces suitable for data that is compositional in nature, such as text or images, may be more efficiently represented with deep hierarchical networks than with shallow ones. Despite the vast empirical evidence supporting this belief, theoretical justifications to date are limited. In particular, they do not account for the locality, sharing and pooling constructs of convolutional networks, the most successful deep learning architecture to date. In this work we derive a deep network architecture based on arithmetic circuits that inherently employs locality, sharing and pooling. An equivalence between the networks and hierarchical tensor factorizations is established. We show that a shallow network corresponds to CP (rank-1) decomposition, whereas a deep network corresponds to Hierarchical Tucker decomposition. Using tools from measure theory and matrix algebra, we prove that besides a negligible set, all functions that can be implemented by a deep network of polynomial size, require exponential size in order to be realized (or even approximated) by a shallow network. Since log-space computation transforms our networks into SimNets, the result applies directly to a deep learning architecture demonstrating promising empirical performance. The construction and theory developed in this paper shed new light on various practices and ideas employed by the deep learning community.},

Policies with finite memory can be represented as finite-state automata. In this paper, we extend Baird and Moore's VAPS algorithm to the problem of learning general finite-state automata. Because it performs stochastic gradient descent, this algorithm can be shown to converge to a locally optimal finitestate controller. We provide the details of the algorithm and then consider the question of under what conditions stochastic gradient descent will outperform exact gradient descent. We conclude with empirical results comparing the performance of stochastic and exact gradient descent, and showing the ability of our algorithm to extract the useful information contained in the sequence of past observations to compensate for the lack of observability at each time-step.},

	Abstract = {To describe certain facets of non-classicality, it is enlightening to quantify properties of operations instead of states. This is the case if one wants to quantify how well an operation detects non-classicality, which is a necessary prerequisite to use it in quantum technologies. To do this rigorously, we build resource theories on the level of operations, exploiting the concept of resource destroying maps. We discuss the two basic ingredients of these resource theories, the free operations and the free super-operations, which are sequential and parallel concatenations with free operations. This leads to defining properties of functionals that are well suited to quantify the resources of operations. We introduce these concepts at the example of coherence. In particular, we present two measures quantifying the ability of an operation to detect, i.e. to use, coherence and provide programs to evaluate them. One of them quantifies how well the map can be simulated by a stochastic process on the populations.},

	Abstract = {Nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is commonly formulated in terms of wavefunctions (probability amplitudes) obeying the static and the time-dependent Schr??dinger equations (SE). Despite the success of this representation of the quantum world a wave-particle duality concept is required to reconcile the theory with observations (experimental measurements). A first solution to this dichotomy was introduced in the de Broglie-Bohm theory according to which a pilot-wave (solution of the SE) is guiding the evolution of particle trajectories. Here, I propose a geometrization of quantum mechanics that describes the time evolution of particles as geodesic lines in a curved space, whose curvature is induced by the quantum potential. This formulation allows therefore the incorporation of all quantum effects into the geometry of space-time, as it is the case for gravitation in the general relativity.},

The quantum computing community has recently begun to generalize this idea and to look for potential applications. In this work, we derive an adversarial algorithm for the problem of approximating an unknown quantum pure state. Although this could be done on universal quantum computers, the adversarial formulation enables us to execute the algorithm on near-term quantum computers. Two parametrized circuits are optimized in tandem: one tries to approximate the target state, the other tries to distinguish between target and approximated state. Supported by numerical simulations, we show that resilient backpropagation algorithms perform remarkably well in optimizing the two circuits. We use the bipartite entanglement entropy to design an efficient heuristic for the stopping criterion. Our approach may find application in quantum state tomography.},

	Abstract = {This paper studies the class of stochastic maps, or channels, whose action (when tensored with the identity) on an entangled state always yields a separable state. Such maps have a canonical form introduced by Holevo. Such maps are called entanglement breaking, and can always be written in a canonical form introduced by Holevo. Some special classes of these maps are considered and several equivalent characterizations given. Since the set of entanglement-breaking trace-preserving maps is convex, it can be described by its extreme points. The only extreme points of the set of completely positive trace preserving maps which are also entanglement breaking are those known as classical quantum or CQ. However, for d {\textgreater} 2 the set of entanglement breaking maps has additional extreme points which are not extreme CQ maps.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPublished in: Rev. Math.

Our results are based on a simple criterion that partitions the set of pure probe states into equivalence classes with the same error probability performance. Under an energy constraint, we find the explicit form of the state that minimizes the error probability. This state is an unentangled but nonclassical single-mode state. The error performance of the optimal state is compared with several standard states in quantum optics. We also show that discrimination with zero error is possible only beyond a threshold energy of (M - 1)/2. For the M = 2 case, we show that the optimum performance is readily demonstrable with current technology. While transmission loss and detector inefficiencies lead to a nonzero erasure probability, the error rate conditional on no erasure is shown to remain the same as the optimal lossless error rate.},

	Abstract = {The pure-interference bosonic multiple access channel has two senders and one receiver, such that the senders each communicate with multiple temporal modes of a single spatial mode of light. The channel mixes the input modes from the two users pairwise on a lossless beamsplitter, and the receiver has access to one of the two output ports. In prior work, Yen and Shapiro found the capacity region of this channel if encodings consist of coherent-state preparations. Here, we demonstrate how to achieve the coherent-state Yen-Shapiro region (for a range of parameters) using a sequential decoding strategy, and we show that our strategy outperforms the rate regions achievable using conventional receivers. Our receiver performs binary-outcome quantum measurements for every codeword pair in the senders' codebooks. A crucial component of this scheme is a non-destructive "vacuum-or-not" measurement that projects an n-symbol modulated codeword onto the n-fold vacuum state or its orthogonal complement, such that the post-measurement state is either the n-fold vacuum or has the vacuum removed from the support of the n symbols' joint quantum state. This receiver requires the additional ability to perform multimode optical phase-space displacements which are realizable using a beamsplitter and a laser.},

	Abstract = {Quantum control is valuable for various quantum technologies such as high-fidelity gates for universal quantum computing, adaptive quantum-enhanced metrology, and ultra-cold atom manipulation. Although supervised machine learning and reinforcement learning are widely used for optimizing control parameters in classical systems, quantum control for parameter optimization is mainly pursued via gradient-based greedy algorithms. Although the quantum fitness landscape is often compatible with greedy algorithms, sometimes greedy algorithms yield poor results, especially for large-dimensional quantum systems. We employ differential evolution algorithms to circumvent the stagnation problem of non-convex optimization. We improve quantum control fidelity for noisy system by averaging over the objective function. To reduce computational cost, we introduce heuristics for early termination of runs and for adaptive selection of search subspaces. Our implementation is massively parallel and vectorized to reduce run time even further. We demonstrate our methods with two examples, namely quantum phase estimation and quantum-gate design, for which we achieve superior fidelity and scalability than obtained using greedy algorithms.},

If a more even-handed treatment of space and time is possible, then such a joint state should be definable, and one might expect it to satisfy the following five conditions: that it is a Hermitian operator on the tensor product of the single-time Hilbert spaces; that it represents probabilistic mixing appropriately; that it has the appropriate classical limit; that it has the appropriate single-time marginals; that composing over multiple time-steps is associative. We show that no construction satisfies all these requirements. If an even-handed treatment of space and time is possible, therefore, one or more axioms must be dropped. In particular, if Hermiticity is dropped, then we show that the construction is fixed uniquely up to an ordering convention.},

Despite the effort devoted so far, however, strategies for optimal discrimination are known only for specific examples. In this paper we consider the problem of minimum-error quantum state discrimination where one attempts to minimize the average error. We show the general structure of minimum-error state discrimination as well as useful properties to derive analytic solutions. Based on the general structure, we present a geometric formulation of the problem, which can be applied to cases where quantum state geometry is clear. We also introduce equivalent classes of sets of quantum states in terms of minimum-error discrimination: sets of quantum states in an equivalent class that share the same guessing probability. In particular, for qubit states where the state geometry is found with the Bloch sphere, we illustrate that for an arbitrary set of qubit states, the minimum-error state discrimination with equal prior probabilities can be analytically solved, that is, optimal measurement and the guessing probability are explicitly obtained.},

For an extremely weak signal input power, there is a crucial gap between the capacity limit and the transmission rates of the WDM system with dyne-type detections.

We show here that this intuition is not true, by demonstrating that a sequential decoding strategy works well even in the most general one-shot' regime, where we are given a single instance of a channel and wish to determine the maximal number of bits that can be communicated up to a small failure probability. This result follows by generalizing a non-commutative union bound to apply for a sequence of general measurements. We also demonstrate two ways in which a receiver can recover a state close to the original state after it has been decoded by a sequence of measurements that each succeed with high probability. The second of these methods will be useful in realizing an efficient decoder for fully quantum polar codes, should a method ever be found to realize an efficient decoder for classical-quantum polar codes.},

In this work, we implement cutting-edge reinforcement learning (RL) techniques and show that their performance is comparable to optimal control methods in the task of finding short, high-fidelity driving protocol from an initial to a target state in nonintegrable many-body quantum systems of interacting qubits. RL methods learn about the underlying physical system solely through a single scalar reward (the fidelity of the resulting state) calculated from numerical simulations of the physical system. We further show that quantum-state manipulation viewed as an optimization problem exhibits a spin-glass-like phase transition in the space of protocols as a function of the protocol duration. Our RL-aided approach helps identify variational protocols with nearly optimal fidelity, even in the glassy phase, where optimal state manipulation is exponentially hard.

	Abstract = {We demonstrate superadditivity in the communication capacity of a binary alphabet consisting of two nonorthogonal quantum states. For this scheme, collective decoding is performed two transmissions at a time. This improves upon the previous schemes of Sasaki et al. [Phys. Rev. A 58, 146 (1998)] where superadditivity was not achieved until a decoding of three or more transmissions at a time. This places superadditivity within the regime of a near-term laboratory demonstration. We propose an experimental test based upon an alphabet of low photon-number coherent states where the signal decoding is done with atomic state measurements on a single atom in a high-finesse optical cavity.},

More generally we consider AD's comprising adaptive procedures based on passive multi-mode Gaussian unitaries and arbitrary single-mode destructive measurements. For classical communication on quantum phase-insensitive Gaussian channels with a coherent-state encoding, we show that the AD's optimal information transmission rate is not greater than that of a single-mode decoder.

We propose an approach in which the optimal measurement is obtained by solving a modified version of the original problem. In particular, the modified problem can be reduced to one of finding a minimum error measurement for a certain state set, which is relatively easy to solve. We clarify the relationship between optimal solutions to the original and modified problems, with which one can obtain an optimal solution to the original problem in some cases. Moreover, as an example of application of our approach, we present an algorithm for numerically obtaining optimal solutions to generalized quantum state discrimination problems.},

The fingerprints can be exponentially smaller than the original strings if the parties preparing the fingerprints share a random key, but not if they only have access to uncorrelated random sources. In this paper we show that fingerprints consisting of quantum information can be made exponentially smaller than the original strings without any correlations or entanglement between the parties: we give a scheme where the quantum fingerprints are exponentially shorter than the original strings and we give a test that distinguishes any two unknown quantum fingerprints with high probability. Our scheme implies an exponential quantum/classical gap for the equality problem in the simultaneous message passing model of communication complexity. We optimize several aspects of our scheme.},

Here we provide a precise description of LOCC and related operational classes in terms of quantum instruments. Our formalism captures both finite round protocols as well as those that utilize an unbounded number of communication rounds. While the set of LOCC is not topologically closed, we show that finite round LOCC constitutes a compact subset of quantum operations. Finally, we demonstrate a two-qubit map whose action can be approached arbitrarily close using LOCC, but nevertheless cannot be implemented perfectly.},

	Abstract = {Optical communication channels are ultimately quantum-mechanical in nature, and we must therefore look beyond classical information theory to determine their communication capacity as well as to find efficient encoding and decoding schemes of the highest rates. Thermal channels, which arise from linear coupling of the field to a thermal environment, are of particular practical relevance; their classical capacity has been recently established, but their quantum capacity remains unknown. While the capacity sets the ultimate limit on reliable communication rates, it does not promise that such rates are achievable by practical means. Here we construct efficiently-encodable codes for thermal channels which achieve the classical capacity and the so-called Gaussian coherent information for transmission of classical and quantum information, respectively. Our codes are based on combining polar codes with a discretization of the channel input into a finite "constellation" of coherent states. Encoding of classical information can be done using linear optics.},

	Abstract = {Condensed-matter physics is the study of the collective behaviour of infinitely complex assemblies of electrons, nuclei, magnetic moments, atoms or qubits. This complexity is reflected in the size of the state space, which grows exponentially with the number of particles, reminiscent of the 'curse of dimensionality' commonly encountered in machine learning. Despite this curse, the machine learning community has developed techniques with remarkable abilities to recognize, classify, and characterize complex sets of data. Here, we show that modern machine learning architectures, such as fully connected and convolutional neural networks, can identify phases and phase transitions in a variety of condensed-matter Hamiltonians. Readily programmable through modern software libraries, neural networks can be trained to detect multiple types of order parameter, as well as highly non-trivial states with no conventional order, directly from raw state configurations sampled with Monte Carlo.},

This development resulted in an elaborated structural theory and was accompanied by the discovery of a whole spectrum of entropic quantities, notably the channel capacities, characterizing information-processing performance of the channels. This paper gives a survey of the main properties of quantum channels and of their entropic characterization, with a variety of examples for finite-dimensional quantum systems. We also touch upon the 'continuous-variables' case, which provides an arena for quantum Gaussian systems. Most of the practical realizations of quantum information processing were implemented in such systems, in particular based on principles of quantum optics. Several important entropic quantities are introduced and used to describe the basic channel capacity formulae. The remarkable role of specific quantum correlations-entanglement-as a novel communication resource is stressed.},

	Abstract = {We study various distance-like entanglement measures of multipartite states under certain symmetries. Using group averaging techniques we provide conditions under which the relative entropy of entanglement, the geometric measure of entanglement and the logarithmic robustness are equivalent. We consider important classes of multiparty states, and in particular show that these measures are equivalent for all stabilizer states, symmetric basis and antisymmetric basis states. We rigorously prove a conjecture that the closest product state of permutation symmetric states can always be chosen to be permutation symmetric. This allows us to calculate the explicit values of various entanglement measures for symmetric and antisymmetric basis states, observing that antisymmetric states are generally more entangled. We use these results to obtain a variety of interesting ensembles of quantum states for which the optimal LOCC discrimination probability may be explicitly determined and achieved. We also discuss applications to the construction of optimal entanglement witnesses.},

@article{wildeThermOpt,
	Abstract = {With the rapid growth of quantum technologies, knowing the fundamental characteristics of quantum systems and protocols is essential for their effective implementation. A particular communication setting that has received increased focus is related to quantum key distribution and distributed quantum computation. In this setting, a quantum channel connects a sender to a receiver, and their goal is to distill either a secret key or entanglement, along with the help of arbitrary local operations and classical communication (LOCC). In this work, we establish a general theory of energy-constrained, LOCC-assisted private and quantum capacities of quantum channels, which are the maximum rates at which an LOCC-assisted quantum channel can reliably establish secret key or entanglement, respectively, subject to an energy constraint on the channel input states. We prove that the energy-constrained squashed entanglement of a channel is an upper bound on these capacities. We also explicitly prove that a thermal state maximizes a relaxation of the squashed entanglement of all phase-insensitive, single-mode input bosonic Gaussian channels, generalizing results from prior work. After doing so, we prove that a variation of the method introduced in [Goodenough et al., New J. Phys. 18, 063005 (2016)] leads to improved upper bounds on the energy-constrained secret-key-agreement capacity of a bosonic thermal channel. We then consider a multipartite setting and prove that two known multipartite generalizations of the squashed entanglement are in fact equal. We finally show that the energy-constrained, multipartite squashed entanglement plays a role in bounding the energy-constrained LOCC-assisted private and quantum capacity regions of quantum broadcast channels.},

	Abstract = {We obtain the optimal scheme for estimating unknown qubit mixed states when an arbitrary number N of identically prepared copies is available. We discuss the case of states in the whole Bloch sphere as well as the restricted situation where these states are known to lie on the equatorial plane. For the former case we obtain that the optimal measurement does not depend on the prior probability distribution provided it is isotropic. Although the equatorial-plane case does not have this property for arbitrary N, we give a prior-independent scheme which becomes optimal in the asymptotic limit of large N. We compute the maximum mean fidelity in this asymptotic regime for the two cases. We show that within the pointwise estimation approach these limits can be obtained in a rather easy and rapid way. This derivation is based on heuristic arguments that are made rigorous by using van Trees inequalities. The interrelation between the estimation of the purity and the direction of the state is also discussed. In the general case we show that they correspond to independent estimations whereas for the equatorial-plane states this is only true asymptotically.},

We consider a number of state discrimination schemes as applied to nonorthogonal, mixed states of a qubit. In particular, we examine the difference that local and global optimization of local measurements makes to the probability of obtaining an erroneous result, in the regime of finite numbers of copies {\$}N{\$}, and in the asymptotic limit as {\$}N \backslashrightarrow \backslashinfty{\$}. Five schemes are considered: optimal collective measurements over all copies, locally optimal local measurements in a fixed single-qubit measurement basis, globally optimal fixed local measurements, locally optimal adaptive local measurements, and globally optimal adaptive local measurements. Here, adaptive measurements are those for which the measurement basis can depend on prior measurement results. For each of these measurement schemes we determine the probability of error (for finite {\$}N{\$}) and scaling of this error in the asymptotic limit. In the asymptotic limit, adaptive schemes have no advantage over the optimal fixed local scheme, and except for states with less than 2{\%} mixture, the most naive scheme (locally optimal fixed local measurements) is as good as any noncollective scheme. For finite {\$}N{\$}, however, the most sophisticated local scheme (globally optimal adaptive local measurements) is better than any other noncollective scheme, for any degree of mixture.},

	Abstract = {Quantum control is valuable for various quantum technologies such as high-fidelity gates for universal quantum computing, adaptive quantum-enhanced metrology, and ultra-cold atom manipulation. Although supervised machine learning and reinforcement learning are widely used for optimizing control parameters in classical systems, quantum control for parameter optimization is mainly pursued via gradient-based greedy algorithms. Although the quantum fitness landscape is often compatible with greedy algorithms, sometimes greedy algorithms yield poor results, especially for large-dimensional quantum systems. We employ differential evolution algorithms to circumvent the stagnation problem of non-convex optimization. We improve quantum control fidelity for noisy system by averaging over the objective function. To reduce computational cost, we introduce heuristics for early termination of runs and for adaptive selection of search subspaces. Our implementation is massively parallel and vectorized to reduce run time even further. We demonstrate our methods with two examples, namely quantum phase estimation and quantum-gate design, for which we achieve superior fidelity and scalability than obtained using greedy algorithms.},

Most of the existing IRL algorithms assume that the environment is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), although it is desirable to handle partially observable settings in order to handle more realistic scenarios. In this paper, we present IRL algorithms for partially observable environments that can be modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We deal with two cases according to the representation of the given expert's behavior, namely the case in which the expert's policy is explicitly given, and the case in which the expert's trajectories are available instead. The IRL in POMDPs poses a greater challenge than in MDPs since it is not only ill-posed due to the nature of IRL, but also computationally intractable due to the hardness in solving POMDPs. To overcome these obstacles, we present algorithms that exploit some of the classical results from the POMDP literature. Experimental results on several benchmark POMDP domains show that our work is useful for partially observable settings. {\textcopyright} 2011 Jaedeug Choi and Kee-Eung Kim.},

We discover a new classical information capacity of quantum channels, the adaptive capacity C{\_}{\{}1,A{\}}, which lies strictly between the C{\_}{\{}1,1{\}} and the C{\_}{\{}1,infinity{\}} capacities. The adaptive capacity requires each of the signals to be measured by a separate apparatus, but allows the quantum states of these signals to be measured in stages, with the first stage partially reducing their quantum states, and where measurements in subsequent stages which further reduce the quantum states may depend on the results of a classical computation taking as input the outcomes of the first round of measurements.},

This allows to describe situations in which the order of events is not fixed, i.e. there are processes where it is not possible to specify whether A causes B or B causes A. Such processes are called causally nonseparable. So far, the formalism has been developed only for finite-dimensional systems and a straightforward generalization to infinite dimensions leads to singularities. Here we develop such generalization, and derive the correlations arising from a causally nonseparable process - the quantum switch - in infinite dimensions. The correlations exhibit interference which is due to superposition of processes in which A is before B and B is before A.},

@article{Kurizki2015,
	Abstract = {An extensively pursued current direction of research in physics aims at the development of practical technologies that exploit the effects of quantum mechanics. As part of this ongoing effort, devices for quantum information processing, secure communication, and high-precision sensing are being implemented with diverse systems, ranging from photons, atoms, and spins to mesoscopic superconducting and nanomechanical structures. Their physical properties make some of these systems better suited than others for specific tasks; thus, photons are well suited for transmitting quantum information, weakly interacting spins can serve as long-lived quantum memories, and superconducting elements can rapidly process information encoded in their quantum states. A central goal of the envisaged quantum technologies is to develop devices that can simultaneously perform several of these tasks, namely, reliably store, process, and transmit quantum information. Hybrid quantum systems composed of different physical components with complementary functionalities may provide precisely such multitasking capabilities. This article reviews some of the driving theoretical ideas and first experimental realizations of hybrid quantum systems and the opportunities and challenges they present and offers a glance at the near-and long-term perspectives of this fascinating and rapidly expanding field. hybrid quantum systems | quantum technologies | quantum information During the last several decades, quantum physics has evolved from being primarily the conceptual framework for the description of microscopic phenomena to providing inspi-ration for new technological applications. A range of ideas for quantum information processing (1) and secure communication (2, 3), quantum enhanced sensing (4--8), and the simulation of complex dynamics (9--14) has given rise to expectations that society may before long benefit from such quantum technologies. These developments are driven by our rapidly evolving abilities to experimentally manipulate and control quantum dynamics in diverse systems, rang-ing from single photons (2, 13), atoms and ions (11, 12), and individual electron and nuclear spins (15--17), to mesoscopic super-conducting (14, 18) and nanomechanical devices (19, 20). As a rule, each of these sys-tems can execute one or a few specific tasks, but no single system can be universally suit-able for all envisioned applications. Thus, photons are best suited for transmitting quantum information, weakly interacting spins may serve as long-lived quantum mem-ories, and the dynamics of electronic states of atoms or electric charges in semiconductors and superconducting elements may realize rapid processing of information encoded in their quantum states. The implementation of devices that can simultaneously perform sev-eral or all of these tasks, e.g., reliably store, process, and transmit quantum states, calls for a new paradigm: that of hybrid quan-tum systems (HQSs) (15, 21--24). HQSs attain their multitasking capabilities by com-bining different physical components with complementary functionalities. Many of the early ideas for HQSs emerged from the field of quantum information pro-cessing and communication (QIPC) and were, to a large extent, inspired by the de-velopment of QIPC architectures in which superconducting qubits are coupled to high-quality microwave resonators (18, 25). Super-conducting qubits are very-well-controlled quantum systems (26, 27), but in contrast to atoms, they suffer from comparatively short coherence times and do not couple coherently to optical photons. A microwave resonator, such as, for example, a lumped-element LC-circuit or coplanar waveguide (CPW) res-onator, can serve as an interface between superconducting qubits and also between superconducting qubits and other quantum systems with longer coherence times and op-tical transitions (18, 22, 23, 28). It has thus been proposed to couple superconducting qubits, via a " microwave quantum bus, " to ions (29), atoms (30--32), polar molecules (33), electrons confined above a liquid helium surface (34), and spin-doped crystals (15, 35--37). With the recent advances in the control of micro-and nanomechanical systems (19, 20), the use of a mechanical quantum bus has},

	Abstract = {Machine learning can help us in solving problems in the context big data analysis and classification, as well as in playing complex games such as Go. But can it also be used to find novel protocols and algorithms for applications such as large-scale quantum communication? Here we show that machine learning can be used to identify central quantum protocols, including teleportation, entanglement purification and the quantum repeater. These schemes are of importance in long-distance quantum communication, and their discovery has shaped the field of quantum information processing. However, the usefulness of learning agents goes beyond the mere re-production of known protocols; the same approach allows one to find improved solutions to long-distance communication problems, in particular when dealing with asymmetric situations where channel noise and segment distance are non-uniform. Our findings are based on the use of projective simulation, a model of a learning agent that combines reinforcement learning and decision making in a physically motivated framework. The learning agent is provided with a universal gate set, and the desired task is specified via a reward scheme. From a technical perspective, the learning agent has to deal with stochastic environments and reactions. We utilize an idea reminiscent of hierarchical skill acquisition, where solutions to sub-problems are learned and re-used in the overall scheme. This is of particular importance in the development of long-distance communication schemes, and opens the way for using machine learning in the design and implementation of quantum networks.},

However, quantum mechanics puts severe limitations on our ability to determine the state of a quantum system. In particular, nonorthogonal states cannot be discriminated perfectly, even if they are known, and various strategies for optimum discrimination with respect to some appropriately chosen criteria have been developed. In this article we review recent theoretical progress regarding the two most important optimum discrimination strategies. We also give a detailed introduction with emphasis on the relevant concepts of the quantum theory of measurement. After a brief introduction into the field, the second chapter deals with optimum unambiguous, i. e error-free, discrimination. Ambiguous discrimination with minimum error is the subject of the third chapter. The fourth chapter is devoted to an overview of the recently emerging subfield of discriminating multiparticle states. We conclude with a brief outlook where we attempt to outline directions of research for the immediate future.},

We study a family of sequential codes parameterized by recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures. We show that creatively designed and trained RNN architectures can decode well known sequential codes such as the convolutional and turbo codes with close to optimal performance on the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, which itself is achieved by breakthrough algorithms of our times (Viterbi and BCJR decoders, representing dynamic programing and forward-backward algorithms).

They rely on the electromagnetic field associated with photons to carry information from one point to another in space. A complete physical model of these channels must necessarily take quantum effects into account to determine their ultimate performances. Single-mode, phase-insensitive bosonic Gaussian channels have been extensively studied over past decades, given their importance for practical applications. In spite of this, a long-standing unsolved conjecture on the optimality of Gaussian encodings has prevented finding their classical communication capacity. Here, this conjecture is solved by proving that the vacuum state achieves the minimum output entropy of these channels. This establishes the ultimate achievable bit rate under an energy constraint, as well as the long awaited proof that the single-letter classical capacity of these channels is additive.},

The measurement describes minimum-error discrimination if this value is zero, while under certain conditions it corresponds to optimized maximum-confidence discrimination, or to optimum unambiguous discrimination, respectively, when the fixed value reaches a definite minimum. Using operator conditions that determine the optimum measurement, we derive analytical solutions for the discrimination of two mixed qubit states, including the case of two pure states occurring with arbitrary prior probabilities, and for the discrimination of N symmetric states, both pure and mixed. We also consider a case where the given density operators resolve the identity operator, and we specify the optimality conditions for the case of partially symmetric states. Moreover, we show that from the complete solution for arbitrary values of the fixed rate of inconclusive results one can always obtain the optimum measurement in another strategy where the error rate is fixed, and vice versa.},

Here we demonstrate that this effect exists for a wide class of inequivalent channels, none of which can simulate each other. We also consider the case where one of two zero capacity channels are applied, but the sender is ignorant of which one is applied. We find examples where the greater the entropy of mixing of the channels, the greater the lower bound for the capacity. Finally, we show that the effect of superactivation is rather generic by providing example of superactivation using the depolarizing channel.},

	Abstract = {A quantum learning machine for binary classification of qubit states that does not require quantum memory is introduced and shown to perform with the minimum error rate allowed by quantum mechanics for any size of the training set. This result is shown to be robust under (an arbitrary amount of) noise and under (statistical) variations in the composition of the training set, provided it is large enough. This machine can be used an arbitrary number of times without retraining. Its required classical memory grows only logarithmically with the number of training qubits, while its excess risk decreases as the inverse of this number, and twice as fast as the excess risk of an "estimate-and-discriminate" machine, which estimates the states of the training qubits and classifies the data qubit with a discrimination protocol tailored to the obtained estimates.},

	Abstract = {In the low-energy high-energy-efficiency regime of classical optical communications---relevant to deep-space optical channels---there is a big gap between reliable communication rates achievable via conventional optical receivers and the ultimate (Holevo) capacity. Achieving the Holevo capacity requires not only optimal codes but also receivers that make collective measurements on long (modulated) codeword waveforms, and it is impossible to implement these collective measurements via symbol-by-symbol detection along with classical postprocessing. Here, we apply our recent results on the classical-quantum polar code---the first near-explicit, linear, symmetric-Holevo-rate achieving code---to the lossy optical channel, and we show that it almost closes the entire gap to the Holevo capacity in the low photon number regime. In contrast, Arikan's original polar codes, applied to the DMC induced by the physical optical channel paired with any conceivable structured optical receiver (including optical homodyne, heterodyne, or direct-detection) fails to achieve the ultimate Holevo limit to channel capacity. However, our polar code construction (which uses the quantum fidelity as a channel parameter rather than the classical Bhattacharyya quantity to choose the "good channels" in the polar-code construction), paired with a quantum successive-cancellation receiver---which involves a sequence of collective non-destructive binary projective measurements on the joint quantum state of the received codeword waveform---can attain the Holevo limit, and can hence in principle achieve higher rates than Arikan's polar code and decoder directly applied to the optical channel. However, even a theoretical recipe for construction of an optical realization of the quantum successive-cancellation receiver remains an open question.},

	Abstract = {We study the problem of decoding classical information encoded on quantum states at the output of a quantum channel, with particular focus on increasing the communication rates towards the maximum allowed by Quantum Mechanics. After a brief introduction to the main theoretical formalism employed in the rest of the thesis, i.e., continuous-variable Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Communication Theory, we consider several decoding schemes. First, we treat the problem from an abstract perspective, presenting a method to decompose any quantum measurement into a sequence of easier nested measurements through a binary-tree search. Furthermore we show that this decomposition can be used to build a capacity-achieving decoding protocol for classical communication on quantum channels and to solve the optimal discrimination of some sets of quantum states. These results clarify the structure of optimal quantum measurements, showing that it can be recast in a more operational and experimentally-oriented fashion. Second, we consider a more practical approach and describe three receiver structures for coherent states of the electromagnetic field with applications to single-mode state discrimination and multi-mode decoding at the output of a quantum channel. We treat the problem bearing in mind the technological limitations faced nowadays in the field of optical communications: we evaluate the performance of general decoding schemes based on such technology and report increased performance of two schemes, the first one employing a non-Gaussian transformation and the second one employing a code tailored to be read out easily by the most common detectors. Eventually we characterize a large class of multi-mode adaptive receivers based on common technological resources, obtaining a no-go theorem for their capacity.},

	Abstract = {The science of quantum information has arisen over the last two decades centered on the manipulation of individual quanta of information, known as quantum bits or qubits. Quantum computers, quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation are among the most celebrated ideas that have emerged from this new field. It was realized later on that using continuous-variable quantum information carriers, instead of qubits, constitutes an extremely powerful alternative approach to quantum information processing. This review focuses on continuous-variable quantum information processes that rely on any combination of Gaussian states, Gaussian operations, and Gaussian measurements. Interestingly, such a restriction to the Gaussian realm comes with various benefits, since on the theoretical side, simple analytical tools are available and, on the experimental side, optical components effecting Gaussian processes are readily available in the laboratory. Yet, Gaussian quantum information processing opens the way to a wide variety of tasks and applications, including quantum communication, quantum cryptography, quantum computation, quantum teleportation, and quantum state and channel discrimination. This review reports on the state of the art in this field, ranging from the basic theoretical tools and landmark experimental realizations to the most recent successful developments.},

Second, we prove that the maximum pay-off for these games is a universal measure of entanglement which is convex and continuous. Third, we show that for the quantification of negative-partial-transpose entanglement, this subset can be further reduced down to a single arbitrary element. Importantly, our measure is operationally accessible in a measurement-device-independent way by construction. Finally, our approach is simply extended to quantify the entanglement within any partitioning of multipartite quantum states.},

This recognition followed by the development of specific quantum resource theories (QRTs), such as entanglement theory, determining how quantum states that cannot be prepared under certain restrictions may be manipulated and used to circumvent the restrictions. Here we discuss the general structure of QRTs, and show that under a few assumptions (such as convexity of the set of free states), a QRT is asymptotically reversible if its set of allowed operations is maximal; that is, if the allowed operations are the set of all operations that do not generate (asymptotically) a resource. In this case, the asymptotic conversion rate is given in terms of the regularized relative entropy of a resource which is the unique measure/quantifier of the resource in the asymptotic limit of many copies of the state. This measure also equals the smoothed version of the logarithmic robustness of the resource.},

Recently a simple photon-number-detection-based implementation of a quantum illumination-like scheme was provided in Phys. Rev. Lett.101, 153603 (2013), where the enhancement was preserved despite the loss of nonclassicality. In the present paper, we investigate the source for quantum advantage in that realization. We introduce an effective two-mode description of the light sources and analyze the mutual information (MI) as a quantifier of total correlations in the effective two-mode picture. In the relevant regime of a highly thermalized background, we find that the improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio achieved by the entangled sources over the unentangled thermal ones amounts exactly to the ratio of the effective MIs of the corresponding sources. More precisely, both quantities tend to a common limit specified by the squared ratio of the respective cross correlations. A thorough analysis of the experimental data confirms this theoretical result.},

	Abstract = {Recent work on quantum machine learning has demonstrated that quantum computers can offer dramatic improvements over classical devices for data mining, prediction and classification. However, less is known about the advantages using quantum computers may bring in the more general setting of reinforcement learning, where learning is achieved via interaction with a task environment that provides occasional rewards. Reinforcement learning can incorporate data-analysis-oriented learning settings as special cases, but also includes more complex situations where, e.g., reinforcing feedback is delayed. In a few recent works, Grover-type amplification has been utilized to construct quantum agents that achieve up-to-quadratic improvements in learning efficiency. These encouraging results have left open the key question of whether super-polynomial improvements in learning times are possible for genuine reinforcement learning problems, that is problems that go beyond the other more restricted learning paradigms. In this work, we provide a family of such genuine reinforcement learning tasks. We construct quantum-enhanced learners which learn super-polynomially, and even exponentially faster than any classical reinforcement learning model, and we discuss the potential impact our results may have on future technologies.},

Recently, this method has been generalized to the realm of quantum information processing, for tasks such as classical communication, private classical communication, and quantum communication. In this paper, we apply the polar coding method to network classical- quantum information theory, by making use of recent advances for related classical tasks. In particular, we consider problems such as the compound multiple access channel and the quantum interference channel. The main result of our work is that it is possible to achieve the best known inner bounds on the achievable rate regions for these tasks, without requiring a so-called quan- tum simultaneous decoder.

For bosonic attenuators we also introduce a further bound based on the bottleneck inequality applied to a particular channel decomposition. With respect to previously known bounds we report better results in a broad range of attenuation and noise values, both for qubit and bosonic attenuators. Even if the exact quantum capacity of thermal attenuators is still unknown, we can approximate it up to an uncertainty which is negligible for most practical applications.},

In the asymptotic limit, coherence distillation and dilution have been proposed by manipulating infinite identical copies of states. In the non-asymptotic setting, finite data-size effects emerge, and the practically relevant problem of coherence manipulation using finite resources has been left open. This letter establishes the one-shot theory of coherence dilution, which involves converting maximally coherent states into an arbitrary quantum state using maximally incoherent operations, dephasing-covariant incoherent operations, incoherent operations, or strictly incoherent operations. We introduce several coherence monotones with concrete operational interpretations that estimate the one-shot coherence cost --- the minimum amount of maximally coherent states needed for faithful coherence dilution. Furthermore, we derive the asymptotic coherence dilution results with maximally incoherent operations, incoherent operations, and strictly incoherent operations as special cases. Our result can be applied in the analyses of quantum information processing tasks that exploit coherence as resources, such as quantum key distribution and random number generation.},

But the essence of quantum formalism - entanglement, recognized by Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen and Schr$\backslash$"odinger - waited over 70 years to enter to laboratories as a new resource as real as energy. This holistic property of compound quantum systems, which involves nonclassical correlations between subsystems, is a potential for many quantum processes, including ``canonical'' ones: quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation and dense coding. However, it appeared that this new resource is very complex and difficult to detect. Being usually fragile to environment, it is robust against conceptual and mathematical tools, the task of which is to decipher its rich structure. This article reviews basic aspects of entanglement including its characterization, detection, distillation and quantifying. In particular, the authors discuss various manifestations of entanglement via Bell inequalities, entropic inequalities, entanglement witnesses, quantum cryptography and point out some interrelations. They also discuss a basic role of entanglement in quantum communication within distant labs paradigm and stress some peculiarities such as irreversibility of entanglement manipulations including its extremal form - bound entanglement phenomenon. A basic role of entanglement witnesses in detection of entanglement is emphasized.},

Among other properties, they offer a single-letter formula for the quantum and the private classical capacity and are characterized by the fact that a complementary channel can be obtained from the channel by applying a degrading channel. In this work we introduce the concept of approximate degradable channels, which satisfy this condition up to some finite {\$}\backslashvarepsilon\backslashgeq0{\$}. That is, there exists a degrading channel which upon composition with the channel is {\$}\backslashvarepsilon{\$}-close in the diamond norm to the complementary channel. We show that for any fixed channel the smallest such {\$}\backslashvarepsilon{\$} can be efficiently determined via a semidefinite program. Moreover, these approximate degradable channels also approximately inherit all other properties of degradable channels. As an application, we derive improved upper bounds to the quantum and private classical capacity for certain channels of interest in quantum communication.},

	Abstract = {Quantum machine learning investigates how quantum computers can be used for data-driven prediction and decision making. The books summarises and conceptualises ideas of this relatively young discipline for an audience of computer scientists and physicists from a graduate level upwards. It aims at providing a starting point for those new to the field, showcasing a toy example of a quantum machine learning algorithm and providing a detailed introduction of the two parent disciplines. For more advanced readers, the book discusses topics such as data encoding into quantum states, quantum algorithms and routines for inference and optimisation, as well as the construction and analysis of genuine ``quantum learning models''. A special focus lies on supervised learning, and applications for near-term quantum devices.

	Abstract = {We consider the transmission of classical information over a quantum channel. The channel is defined by an ``alphabet'' of quantum states, e.g., certain photon polarizations, together with a specified set of probabilities with which these states must be sent. If the receiver is restricted to making separate measurements on the received ``letter'' states, then the Kholevo theorem implies that the amount of information transmitted per letter cannot be greater than the von Neumann entropy H of the letter ensemble. In fact the actual amount of transmitted information will usually be significantly less than H. We show, however, that if the sender uses a block coding scheme consisting of a choice of code words that respects the a priori probabilities of the letter states, and the receiver distinguishes whole words rather than individual letters, then the information transmitted per letter can be made arbitrarily close to H and never exceeds H. This provides a precise information-theoretic interpretation of von Neumann entropy in quantum mechanics. We apply this result to ``superdense'' coding, and we consider its extension to noisy channels. {\textcopyright} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Hoehn2015,
	Abstract = {We reconstruct the explicit formalism of qubit quantum theory from elementary rules on an observer's information acquisition. Our approach is purely operational: we consider an observer O interrogating a system S with binary questions and define S's state as O's `catalogue of knowledge' about S; no ontic assumptions are necessary. From the rules we derive the state spaces for N qubits and show that (a) they coincide with the set of density matrices over N qubit Hilbert spaces; (b) states evolve unitarily under the group {\$}\backslashrm{\{}PSU{\}}(2{\^{}}N){\$} according to the von Neumann evolution equation; and (c) the binary questions by means of which O interrogates the systems corresponds to projective measurements on Pauli operators with outcome probabilities given by the Born rule. Besides offering a novel conceptual perspective on qubit quantum theory, the reconstruction also unravels new structural insights. Namely, we show that, in a quadratic information measure, (d) qubits satisfy informational complementarity inequalities which bound the information content in any set of mutually complementary questions to 1 bit; and (e) maximal sets of mutually complementary questions for 2 qubits must carry precisely 1 bit of information in pure states. The latter relations constitute 6 conserved informational charges which define the unitary group and, together with their 15 conservation conditions, the set of pure states. This underscores the benefits of this informational approach and emphasizes the sufficiency of restricting to an observer's information in order to reconstruct the theory.

	Abstract = {Coding theorems and (strong) converses for memoryless quantum communication channels and quantum sources are proved: for the quantum source the coding theorem is reviewed, and the strong converse proven. For classical information transmission via quantum channels we give a new proof of the coding theorem, and prove the strong converse, even under the extended model of nonstationary channels. As a by-product we obtain a new proof of the famous Holevo bound. Then multi-user systems are investigated, and the capacity region for the quantum multiple access channel is determined. The last chapter contains a preliminary discussion of some models of compression of correlated quantum sources, and a proposal for a program to obtain operational meaning for quantum conditional entropy. An appendix features the introduction of a notation and calculus of entropy in quantum systems.},

	Abstract = {In the last years the exploitation of specific properties of quantum states has disclosed the possibility of realising tasks beyond classical limits, creating the new field of quantum technologies [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Among them, quantum metrology and imaging aim to improve the sensitivity and/or resolution of measurements exploiting non-classical features such as squeezing and quantum correlations (entanglement and discordant states) [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Nevertheless, in most of the realistic scenarios losses and noise are known to nullify the advantage of adopting quantum strategies [15]. In this paper we describe in detail the first experimental realization of quantum illumination protocol aimed to target detection in a noisy environment, that preserves a strong advantage over the classical counterparts even in presence of large amount of noise and losses. The experiment, inspired by the theoretical ideas elaborated in [16, 17, 18, 19] (see also [20, 21]), has been performed exploiting only photon number correlations in twin beams. Thus, for its simplicity it can find widespread use. Even more important by challenging the common believe that real application of quantum technologies is limited by their fragility to noise and losses, it paves the way to their real application.},

It is shown that deep learning methods can be used to improve a standard belief propagation decoder, despite the large example space. Similar improvements are obtained for the min-sum algorithm. It is also shown that tying the parameters of the decoders across iterations, so as to form a recurrent neural network architecture, can be implemented with comparable results. The advantage is that significantly less parameters are required. We also introduce a recurrent neural decoder architecture based on the method of successive relaxation. Improvements over standard belief propagation are also observed on sparser Tanner graph representations of the codes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the neural belief propagation decoder can be used to improve the performance, or alternatively reduce the computational complexity, of a close to optimal decoder of short BCH codes.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a new quantum-like method for the binary classification applied to classical datasets. Inspired by the quantum Helstrom measurement, this innovative approach has enabled us to define a new classifier, called Helstrom Quantum Centroid (HQC). This binary classifier (inspired by the concept of distinguishability between quantum states) acts on density matrices---called density patterns---that are the quantum encoding of classical patterns of a dataset. In this paper we compare the performance of HQC with respect to twelve standard (linear and non-linear) classifiers over fourteen different datasets. The experimental results show that HQC outperforms the other classifiers when compared to the Balanced Accuracy and other statistical measures. Finally, we show that the performance of our classifier is positively correlated to the increase in the number of ``quantum copies'' of a pattern and the resulting tensor product thereof.},

Helstrom [1] proposed that the axioms of quantum mechanics be incorporated into a quantum approach to optical estimation and detection. In this paper, we discuss two important results, the quantum equivalent of the minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) estimator and the quantum Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao bound for estimation of the parameters of an electromagnetic field. The first result, a new one, is applied to linear modulation. We show that homodyning is the optimal demodulation scheme in that case. Parallels to the classical MMSE estimator are drawn. The Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao bound, first derived in the quantum ease by Helstrom [1], is applied to specific estimation problems. Details are left to the references, but interesting results are presented.},

One type of measurement is shown to be optimal in the limit of small photon numbers for any N. For the special case of N=4 this measurement can be fruitfully used by the receiving end (Bob) in an implementation of the Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) quantum key distribution protocol using faint laser pulses. In particular, if Bob detects only a single photon the procedure is equivalent to the standard measurement that he would have to perform in a single-photon implementation of BB84, if he detects two photons Bob will unambiguously know the bit sent to him in 50{\%} of the cases without having to exchange basis information, and if three photons are detected, Bob will know unambiguously which quantum state was sent.},

	Abstract = {We address the problem of estimating pure qubit states with non-ideal (noisy) measurements in the multiple-copy scenario, where the data consist of a number N of identically prepared qubits. We show that the average fidelity of the estimates can increase significantly if the estimation protocol allows for inconclusive answers, or abstentions. We present the optimal protocol and compute its fidelity for a given probability of abstention. The improvement over standard estimation, without abstention, can be viewed as an effective noise reduction. These and other results are illustrated for small valuesof N . For asymptotically large N , we derive analytical expressions of the fidelity and the probability of abstention and show that for a fixed fidelity gain the latter decreases with N at an exponential rate given by a Kulback--Leibler (relative) entropy. As a byproduct, we give an asymptotic expression in terms of this very entropy of the probability that a system of N qubits, all prepared in the same state, has a given total angular momentum. We also discuss an extreme situation where noise increases with N and where estimation with abstention provides the most significant improvement as compared to the standard approach.},

Its analysis is usually conducted within specific frameworks, for which the set of input states for a given protocol is fixed. Here we obtain a more general description by showing that a noisy and lossy Gaussian channel followed by a NLA has a general description in terms of effective channels. This has the advantage of offering a simpler mathematical description, best suitable for mixed states, both Gaussian and non-Gaussian. We investigate the main properties of this effective system, and illustrate its potential by applying it to loss compensation and reduction of phase uncertainty.},

	Abstract = {How far can we take the resource theoretic approach to explore physics? Resource theories like LOCC, reference frames and quantum thermodynamics have proven a powerful tool to study how agents who are subject to certain constraints can act on physical systems. This approach has advanced our understanding of fundamental physical principles, such as the second law of thermodynamics, and provided operational measures to quantify resources such as entanglement or information content. In this work, we significantly extend the approach and range of applicability of resource theories. Firstly we generalize the notion of resource theories to include any description or knowledge that agents may have of a physical state, beyond the density operator formalism. We show how to relate theories that differ in the language used to describe resources, like micro and macroscopic thermodynamics. Finally, we take a top-down approach to locality, in which a subsystem structure is derived from a global theory rather than assumed. The extended framework introduced here enables us to formalize new tasks in the language of resource theories, ranging from tomography, cryptography, thermodynamics and foundational questions, both within and beyond quantum theory.},

	Abstract = {With increasing communication rates via quantum channels, memory effects become unavoidable whenever the use rate of the channel is comparable to the typical relaxation time of the channel environment. We introduce a model of a bosonic memory channel, describing correlated noise effects in quantum-optical processes via attenuating or amplifying media. To study such a channel model, we make use of a proper set of collective field variables, which allows us to unravel the memory effects, mapping the n-fold concatenation of the memory channel to a unitarily equivalent, direct product of n single-mode bosonic channels. We hence estimate the channel capacities by relying on known results for the memoryless setting. Our findings show that the model is characterized by two different regimes, in which the cross correlations induced by the noise among different channel uses are either exponentially enhanced or exponentially reduced.},

Our bound reveals that while linear networks can generate highly entangled states, they cannot effectively combine quantum resources that are well distributed across multiple modes for the purposes of metrology: in this sense linear networks endowed with well-distributed quantum resources behave classically. Conversely, our bound shows that linear networks can achieve the Heisenberg limit for distributed metrology when the input photons are hoarded in a small number of input modes, and we present an explicit scheme for doing so. Our results also have implications for measures of non-classicality.},

	Abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms pro-vide a sound theoretical basis for building learning control architectures for embedded agents. Unfortunately all of the theory and much of the practice (see Barto et al., 1983, for an exception) of RL is limited to Marko-vian decision processes (MDPs). Many real-world decision tasks, however, are inherently non-Markovian, i.e., the state of the environ-ment is only incompletely known to the learn-ing agent. In this paper we consider only par-tially observable MDPs (POMDPs), a use-ful class of non-Markovian decision processes. Most previous approaches to such prob-lems have combined computationally expen-sive state-estimation techniques with learn-ing control. This paper investigates learning in POMDPs without resorting to any f o r m of state estimation. We present results about what TD(0) and Q-learning will do when ap-plied to POMDPs. It is shown that the con-ventional discounted RL framework is inad-equate to deal with POMDPs. Finally we develop a new framework for learning with-out state-estimation in POMDPs by includ-ing stochastic policies in the search space, and by deening the value or utility o f a dis-tribution over states.},

This is the timeless approach to time, which assumes that the universe is in a stationary state, where two non-interacting subsystems, the " clock " and the " rest " , are entangled. As a consequence, by choosing a suitable observable of the clock, the rel-ative state of the rest of the universe evolves unitarily with respect to the variable labelling the clock observable's eigenstates, which is then interpreted as time. This model for an " evolution without evolution " (Page and Wootters, 1983), albeit elegant, has never been developed further, because it was criticised for generating severe ambiguities in the dynamics of the rest of the universe. In this paper we show that there are no such ambiguities; we also update the model, making it amenable to possible new applications.},

	Abstract = {We develop a quantum learning scheme for binary discrimination of coherent states of light. This is a problem of technological relevance for the reading of information stored in a digital memory. In our setting, a coherent light source is used to illuminate a memory cell and retrieve its encoded bit by determining the quantum state of the reflected signal. We consider a situation where the amplitude of the states produced by the source is not fully known, but instead this information is encoded in a large training set comprising many copies of the same coherent state. We show that an optimal global measurement, performed jointly over the signal and the training set, provides higher successful identification rates than any learning strategy based on first estimating the unknown amplitude by means of Gaussian measurements on the training set, followed by an adaptive discrimination procedure on the signal. By considering a simplified variant of the problem, we argue that this is the case even for non-Gaussian estimation measurements. Our results show that, even in absence of entanglement, collective quantum measurements yield an enhancement in the readout of classical information, which is particularly relevant in the operating regime of low-energy signals.},

	Abstract = {Quantum illumination is a quantum-optical sensing technique in which an entangled source is exploited to improve the detection of a low-reflectivity object that is immersed in a bright thermal background. Here we describe and analyze a system for applying this technique at microwave frequencies, a more appropriate spectral region for target detection than the optical, due to the naturally-occurring bright thermal background in the microwave regime. We use an electro-opto- mechanical converter to entangle microwave signal and optical idler fields, with the former being sent to probe the target region and the latter being retained at the source. The microwave radiation collected from the target region is then phase conjugated and upconverted into an optical field that is combined with the retained idler in a joint-detection quantum measurement. The error probability of this microwave quantum-illumination system, or quantum radar, is shown to be superior to that of any classical microwave radar of equal transmitted energy},

	Abstract = {Communication over proven-secure quantum channels is potentially one of the most wide-ranging applications of currently developed quantum technologies. It is generally envisioned that in future quantum networks, separated nodes containing stationary solid-state or atomic qubits are connected via the exchange of optical photons over large distances. In this work we explore an intriguing alternative for quantum communication via all-microwave networks. To make this possible, we describe a general protocol for sending quantum states through thermal channels, even when the number of thermal photons in the channel is much larger than one. The protocol can be implemented with state-of-the-art superconducting circuits and enables the transfer of quantum states over distances of {\~{}}100 m via microwave transmission lines cooled to only T=4K. This opens up completely new possibilities for quantum communication within and across buildings, and consequently, for the implementation of intra-city quantum networks based on microwave technology only.},

	Abstract = {Machine learning with artificial neural networks is revolutionizing science. The most advanced challenges require discovering answers autonomously. In the domain of reinforcement learning, control strategies are improved according to a reward function. The power of neural-network-based reinforcement learning has been highlighted by spectacular recent successes such as playing Go, but its benefits for physics are yet to be demonstrated. Here, we show how a network-based "agent" can discover complete quantum-error-correction strategies, protecting a collection of qubits against noise. These strategies require feedback adapted to measurement outcomes. Finding them from scratch without human guidance and tailored to different hardware resources is a formidable challenge due to the combinatorially large search space. To solve this challenge, we develop two ideas: two-stage learning with teacher and student networks and a reward quantifying the capability to recover the quantum information stored in a multiqubit system. Beyond its immediate impact on quantum computation, our work more generally demonstrates the promise of neural-network-based reinforcement learning in physics.},

@article{seqCoh,
	Abstract = {An important practical open question has been to design explicit, structured optical receivers that achieve the Holevo limit in the contexts of optical communication and "quantum reading." The Holevo limit is an achievable rate that is higher than the Shannon limit of any known optical receiver. We demonstrate how a sequential decoding approach can achieve the Holevo limit for both of these settings. A crucial part of our scheme for both settings is a non-destructive "vacuum-or-not" measurement that projects an n-symbol modulated codeword onto the n-fold vacuum state or its orthogonal complement, such that the post-measurement state is either the n-fold vacuum or has the vacuum removed from the support of the n symbols' joint quantum state. The sequential decoder for optical communication requires the additional ability to perform multimode optical phase-space displacements---realizable using a beamsplitter and a laser, while the sequential decoder for quantum reading also requires the ability to perform phase-shifting (realizable using a phase plate) and online squeezing (a phase-sensitive amplifier).},

In this paper, we propose a general scheme for analyzing resource theories based on resource destroying maps, which leave resource-free states unchanged but erase the resource stored in all other states. We introduce a group of general conditions that determine whether a quantum operation exhibits typical resource-free properties in relation to a given resource destroying map. Our theory reveals fundamental connections among basic elements of resource theories, in particular, free states, free operations, and resource measures. In particular, we define a class of simple resource measures that can be calculated without optimization, and that are monotone nonincreasing under operations that commute with the resource destroying map. We apply our theory to the resources of coherence and quantum correlations (e.g., discord), two prominent features of nonclassicality.},

To address this possibility, we consider a class of classical theories satisfying the minimal postulates of macrorealism and frame Leggett-Garg-type tests that could rule them out.

	Abstract = {Quantum coherence is an essential ingredient in quantum information processing and plays a central role in emergent fields such as nanoscale thermodynamics and quantum biology. However, our understanding and quantitative characterization of coherence as an operational resource are still very limited. Here we show that any degree of coherence with respect to some reference basis can be converted to entanglement via incoherent operations. This finding allows us to define a novel general class of measures of coherence for a quantum system of arbitrary dimension, in terms of the maximum bipartite entanglement that can be generated via incoherent operations applied to the system and an incoherent ancilla. The resulting measures are proven to be valid coherence monotones satisfying all the requirements dictated by the resource theory of quantum coherence. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by proving that the fidelity-based geometric measure of coherence is a full convex coherence monotone, and deriving a closed formula for it on arbitrary single-qubit states. Our work provides a clear quantitative and operational connection between coherence and entanglement, two landmark manifestations of quantum theory and both key enablers for quantum technologies.},

	Abstract = {A method is proposed, called channel polarization, to construct code sequences that achieve the symmetric capacity {\$}I(W){\$} of any given binary-input discrete memoryless channel (B-DMC) {\$}W{\$}. The symmetric capacity is the highest rate achievable subject to using the input letters of the channel with equal probability. Channel polarization refers to the fact that it is possible to synthesize, out of {\$}N{\$} independent copies of a given B-DMC {\$}W{\$}, a second set of {\$}N{\$} binary-input channels {\$}\backslash{\{}W{\_}N{\^{}}{\{}(i){\}}:1\backslashle i\backslashle N\backslash{\}}{\$} such that, as {\$}N{\$} becomes large, the fraction of indices {\$}i{\$} for which {\$}I(W{\_}N{\^{}}{\{}(i){\}}){\$} is near 1 approaches {\$}I(W){\$} and the fraction for which {\$}I(W{\_}N{\^{}}{\{}(i){\}}){\$} is near 0 approaches {\$}1-I(W){\$}. The polarized channels {\$}\backslash{\{}W{\_}N{\^{}}{\{}(i){\}}\backslash{\}}{\$} are well-conditioned for channel coding: one need only send data at rate 1 through those with capacity near 1 and at rate 0 through the remaining. Codes constructed on the basis of this idea are called polar codes. The paper proves that, given any B-DMC {\$}W{\$} with {\$}I(W){\textgreater}0{\$} and any target rate {\$}R {\textless} I(W){\$}, there exists a sequence of polar codes {\$}\backslash{\{}{\{}\backslashmathscr C{\}}{\_}n;n\backslashge 1\backslash{\}}{\$} such that {\$}{\{}\backslashmathscr C{\}}{\_}n{\$} has block-length {\$}N=2{\^{}}n{\$}, rate {\$}\backslashge R{\$}, and probability of block error under successive cancellation decoding bounded as {\$}P{\_}{\{}e{\}}(N,R) \backslashle \backslashbigoh(N{\^{}}{\{}-\backslashfrac14{\}}){\$} independently of the code rate. This performance is achievable by encoders and decoders with complexity {\$}O(N\backslashlog N){\$} for each.},

	Abstract = {Reinforcement learning policies face the exploration versus exploitation dilemma, i.e. the search for a balance between exploring the environment to find profitable actions while taking the empirically best action as often as possible. A popular measure of a policy's success in addressing this dilemma is the regret, that is the loss due to the fact that the globally optimal policy is not followed all the times. One of the simplest examples of the exploration/exploitation dilemma is the multi-armed bandit problem. Lai and Robbins were the first ones to show that the regret for this problem has to grow at least logarithmically in the number of plays. Since then, policies which asymptotically achieve this regret have been devised by Lai and Robbins and many others. In this work we show that the optimal logarithmic regret is also achievable uniformly over time, with simple and efficient policies, and for all reward distributions with bounded support.},

	Abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning has yielded proficient controllers for complex tasks. However, these controllers have limited memory and rely on being able to perceive the complete game screen at each decision point. To address these shortcomings, this article investigates the effects of adding recurrency to a Deep Q-Network (DQN) by replacing the first post-convolutional fully-connected layer with a recurrent LSTM. The resulting Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN), although capable of seeing only a single frame at each timestep, successfully integrates information through time and replicates DQN's performance on standard Atari games and partially observed equivalents featuring flickering game screens. Additionally, when trained with partial observations and evaluated with incrementally more complete observations, DRQN's performance scales as a function of observability. Conversely, when trained with full observations and evaluated with partial observations, DRQN's performance degrades less than DQN's. Thus, given the same length of history, recurrency is a viable alternative to stacking a history of frames in the DQN's input layer and while recurrency confers no systematic advantage when learning to play the game, the recurrent net can better adapt at evaluation time if the quality of observations changes.},

	Abstract = {In supervised learning, an inductive learning algorithm extracts general rules from observed training instances, then the rules are applied to test instances. We show that this splitting of training and application arises naturally, in the classical setting, from a simple independence requirement with a physical interpretation of being non-signalling. Thus, two seemingly different definitions of inductive learning happen to coincide. This follows from the properties of classical information that break down in the quantum setup. We prove a quantum de Finetti theorem for quantum channels, which shows that in the quantum case, the equivalence holds in the asymptotic setting, that is, for large number of test instances. This reveals a natural analogy between classical learning protocols and their quantum counterparts, justifying a similar treatment, and allowing to inquire about standard elements in computational learning theory, such as structural risk minimization and sample complexity.},

Here we solve a quantum analogue of this problem, namely the classification of two arbitrary unknown qubit states. Given a number of `training' copies from each of the states, we would like to `learn' about them by performing a measurement on the training set. The outcome is then used to design mesurements for the classification of future systems with unknown labels. We find the asymptotically optimal classification strategy and show that typically, it performs strictly better than a plug-in strategy based on state estimation. The figure of merit is the excess risk which is the difference between the probability of error and the probability of error of the optimal measurement when the states are known, that is the Helstrom measurement. We show that the excess risk has rate {\$}n{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} and compute the exact constant of the rate.},

	Abstract = {Quantum information and computation provide a fascinating twist on the notion of proofs in computational complexity theory. For instance, one may consider a quantum computational analogue of the complexity class $\backslash$class{\{}NP{\}}, known as QMA, in which a quantum state plays the role of a proof (also called a certificate or witness), and is checked by a polynomial-time quantum computation. For some problems, the fact that a quantum proof state could be a superposition over exponentially many classical states appears to offer computational advantages over classical proof strings. In the interactive proof system setting, one may consider a verifier and one or more provers that exchange and process quantum information rather than classical information during an interaction for a given input string, giving rise to quantum complexity classes such as QIP, QSZK, and QMIP* that represent natural quantum analogues of IP, SZK, and MIP. While quantum interactive proof systems inherit some properties from their classical counterparts, they also possess distinct and uniquely quantum features that lead to an interesting landscape of complexity classes based on variants of this model.   In this survey we provide an overview of many of the known results concerning quantum proofs, computational models based on this concept, and properties of the complexity classes they define. In particular, we discuss non-interactive proofs and the complexity class QMA, single-prover quantum interactive proof systems and the complexity class QIP, statistical zero-knowledge quantum interactive proof systems and the complexity class $\backslash$class{\{}QSZK{\}}, and multiprover interactive proof systems and the complexity classes QMIP, QMIP*, and MIP*.},

For instance, determining the quantum entropy generated by a Bogoliubov transformation is notably a hard problem, with generally no known analytical solution, while it is vital to the characterisation of quantum communication via bosonic channels. Here we overcome this difficulty by adapting the replica method, a tool borrowed from statistical physics and quantum field theory. We exhibit a first application of this method to continuous-variable quantum information theory, where it enables accessing entropies in an optical parametric amplifier. As an illustration, we determine the entropy generated by amplifying a binary superposition of the vacuum and a Fock state, which yields a surprisingly simple, yet unknown analytical expression.},

Its usage on classical data finds diverse applications in many important areas like fraud detection, medical diagnoses, data cleaning and surveillance. With the advent of quantum technologies, anomaly detection of quantum data, in the form of quantum states, may become an important component of quantum applications. Machine learning algorithms are playing pivotal roles in anomaly detection using classical data. Two widely-used algorithms are kernel principal component analysis and one-class support vector machine. We find corresponding quantum algorithms to detect anomalies in quantum states. We show that these two quantum algorithms can be performed using resources logarithmic in the dimensionality of quantum states. For pure quantum states, these resources can also be logarithmic in the number of quantum states used for training the machine learning algorithm.

	Abstract = {Powerful Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECCs) are required for stabilizing and protecting fragile qubits against the undesirable effects of quantum decoherence. Similar to classical codes, hashing bound approaching QECCs may be designed by exploiting a concatenated code structure, which invokes iterative decoding. Therefore, in this paper we provide an extensive step-by-step tutorial for designing EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart aided concatenated quantum codes based on the underlying quantum-to-classical isomorphism. These design lessons are then exemplified in the context of our proposed Quantum Irregular Convolutional Code (QIRCC), which constitutes the outer component of a concatenated quantum code. The proposed QIRCC can be dynamically adapted to match any given inner code using EXIT charts, hence achieving a performance close to the hashing bound. It is demonstrated that our QIRCC-based optimized design is capable of operating within 0.4 dB of the noise limit.},

	Abstract = {The basic idea of quantum computing is surprisingly similar to that of kernel methods in machine learning, namely to efficiently perform computations in an intractably large Hilbert space. In this paper we explore some theoretical foundations of this link and show how it opens up a new avenue for the design of quantum machine learning algorithms. We interpret the process of encoding inputs in a quantum state as a nonlinear feature map that maps data to quantum Hilbert space. A quantum computer can now analyse the input data in this feature space. Based on this link, we discuss two approaches for building a quantum model for classification. In the first approach, the quantum device estimates inner products of quantum states to compute a classically intractable kernel. This kernel can be fed into any classical kernel method such as a support vector machine. In the second approach, we can use a variational quantum circuit as a linear model that classifies data explicitly in Hilbert space. We illustrate these ideas with a feature map based on squeezing in a continuous-variable system, and visualise the working principle with 2-dimensional mini-benchmark datasets.},

	Abstract = {For the discrete memoryless quantum channel, we show the equivalence of two different notions of quantum channel capacity: that which uses the entanglement fidelity as its criterion for success in transmission, and that which uses the minimum fidelity of pure states in a subspace of the input Hilbert space as its criterion. As a corollary, any source with entropy rate less than the capacity may be transmitted with high entanglement fidelity. We also show that a restricted class of encodings is sufficient to transmit any quantum source which may be transmitted on a given channel. This enables us to simplify a known upper bound for the channel capacity. It also enables us to show that the availability of an auxiliary classical channel from encoder to decoder does not increase the quantum capacity},

	Abstract = {Methods are developed for discussing the photon statistics of arbitrary radiation fields in fully quantum- mechanical terms. In order to keep the classical limit of quantum electrodynamics plainly in view, extensive use is made of the coherent states of the field. These states, which reduce the field correlation functions to factorized forms, are shown to offer a convenient basis for the description of fields of all types. Although they are not orthogonal to one another, the coherent states form a complete set. It is shown that any quan- tum state of the field may be expanded in terms of them in a unique way. Expansions are also developed for arbitrary operators in terms of products of the coherent state vectors. These expansions are discussed as a general method of representing the density operator for the field. A particular form is exhibited for the density operator which makes it possible to carry out many quantum-mechanical calculations by methods resembling those of classical theory. This representation permits clear insights into the essential distinction between the quantum and classical descriptions of the field. It leads, in addition, to a simple formulation of a superposition law for photon fields. Detailed discussions are given of the incoherent fields which are generated by superposing the outputs of many stationary sources. These fields are all shown to have inti- mately related properties, some of which have been known for the particular case of blackbody radiation.},

	Abstract = {The achievable rate of information transfer in optical communications is determined by the physical properties of the communication channel, such as the intrinsic channel noise. Bosonic phase-noise channels, a class of non-Gaussian channels, have emerged as a relevant noise model in quantum information and optical communication. However, while the fundamental limits for communication over Gaussian channels have been extensively studied, the properties of communication over Bosonic phase-noise channels are not well understood. Here we propose and demonstrate experimentally the concept of optimized communication strategies for communication over phase-noise channels to enhance information transfer beyond what is possible with conventional methods of modulation and detection. Two key ingredients are generalized constellations of coherent states that interpolate between standard on-off keying and binary phase shift keying formats, and non-Gaussian measurements based on photon number resolving detection of the coherently displaced signal. For a given power constraint and channel noise strength, these novel strategies rely on joint optimization of the input alphabet and the measurement to provide enhanced communication capability over a non-Gaussian channel characterized in terms of the error rate as well as mutual information.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we study the power of sequential decoding strategies for several channels with classical input and quantum output. In our sequential decoding strategies, the receiver loops through all candidate messages trying to project the received state onto a `typical' subspace for the candidate message under consideration, stopping if the projection succeeds for a message, which is then declared as the guess of the receiver for the sent message. We show that even such a conceptually simple strategy can be used to achieve rates up to the mutual information for a single sender single receiver channel called cq-channel henceforth, as well as the standard inner bound for a two sender single receiver multiple access channel, called ccq-MAC in this paper. Our decoding scheme for the ccq-MAC uses a new kind of conditionally typical projector which is constructed using a geometric result about how two subspaces interact structurally. As the main application of our methods, we construct an encoding and decoding scheme achieving the Chong-Motani-Garg inner bound for a two sender two receiver interference channel with classical input and quantum output, called ccqq-IC henceforth. This matches the best known inner bound for the interference channel in the classical setting. Achieving the Chong-Motani-Garg inner bound, which is known to be equivalent to the Han-Kobayashi inner bound, answers an open question raised recently by Fawzi et al. (arxiv:1102.2624). Our encoding scheme is the same as that of Chong-Motani-Garg, and our decoding scheme is sequential.},

	Abstract = {How useful can machine learning be in a quantum laboratory? Here we raise the question of the potential of intelligent machines in the context of scientific research. A major motivation for the present work is the unknown reachability of various entanglement classes in quantum experiments. We investigate this question by using the projective simulation model, a physics-oriented approach to artificial intelligence. In our approach, the projective simulation system is challenged to design complex photonic quantum experiments that produce high-dimensional entangled multiphoton states, which are of high interest in modern quantum experiments. The artificial intelligence system learns to create a variety of entangled states and improves the efficiency of their realization. In the process, the system autonomously (re)discovers experimental techniques which are only now becoming standard in modern quantum optical experiments-a trait which was not explicitly demanded from the system but emerged through the process of learning. Such features highlight the possibility that machines could have a significantly more creative role in future research.},

@article{King2005,
	Abstract = {Quantum channels can be described via a unitary coupling of system and environment, followed by a trace over the environment state space. Taking the trace instead over the system state space produces a different mapping which we call the conjugate channel. We explore the properties of conjugate channels and describe several different methods of construction. In general, conjugate channels map M{\_}d to M{\_}d' with d {\textless} d', and different constructions may differ by conjugation with a partial isometry. We show that a channel and its conjugate have the same minimal output entropy and maximal output p-norm. It then follows that the additivity and multiplicativity conjectures for these measures of optimal output purity hold for a product of channels if and only if they also hold for the product of their conjugates. This allows us to reduce these conjectures to the special case of maps taking M{\_}d to M{\_}d' with a minimal representation of dimension at most d. We find explicit expressions for the conjugates for a number of well-known examples, including entanglement-breaking channels, unital qubit channels, the depolarizing channel, and a subclass of random unitary channels. For the entanglement-breaking channels, channels this yields a new class of channels for which additivity and multiplicativity of optimal output purity can be established. For random unitary channels using the generalized Pauli matrices, we obtain a new formulation of the multiplicativity conjecture. The conjugate of the completely noisy channel plays a special role and suggests a mechanism for using noise to transmit information.},

	Abstract = {Considerable work has recently been directed toward developing resource theories of quantum coherence. In most approaches, a state is said to possess quantum coherence if it is not diagonal in some specified basis. In this letter we establish a criterion of physical consistency for any resource theory in terms of physical implementation of the free operations, and we show that all currently proposed basis-dependent theories of coherence fail to satisfy this criterion. We further characterize the physically consistent resource theory of coherence and find its operational power to be quite limited. After relaxing the condition of physical consistency, we introduce the class of dephasing-covariant incoherent operations, present a number of new coherent monotones based on relative R{\'{e}}nyi entropies, and study incoherent state transformations under different operational classes. In particular, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for qubit state transformations and show these conditions hold for all classes of incoherent operations.},

The task of an autoencoder is, given an input {\$}x{\$}, is to map {\$}x{\$} to a lower dimensional point {\$}y{\$} such that {\$}x{\$} can likely be recovered from {\$}y{\$}. The structure of the underlying autoencoder network can be chosen to represent the data on a smaller dimension, effectively compressing the input. Inspired by this idea, we introduce the model of a quantum autoencoder to perform similar tasks on quantum data. The quantum autoencoder is trained to compress a particular dataset of quantum states, where a classical compression algorithm cannot be employed. The parameters of the quantum autoencoder are trained using classical optimization algorithms. We show an example of a simple programmable circuit that can be trained as an efficient autoencoder. We apply our model in the context of quantum simulation to compress ground states of the Hubbard model and molecular Hamiltonians.},

	Abstract = {For any given channel {\$}W{\$} with classical inputs and possibly quantum outputs, a dual classical-input channel {\$}W{\^{}}\backslashperp{\$} can be defined by embedding the original into a channel {\$}\backslashmathcal N{\$} with quantum inputs and outputs. Here we give new uncertainty relations for a general class of entropies that lead to very close relationships between the original channel and its dual. Moreover, we show that channel duality can be combined with duality of linear codes, whereupon the uncertainty relations imply that the performance of a given code over a given channel is entirely characterized by the performance of the dual code on the dual channel. This has several applications. In the context of polar codes, it implies that the rates of polarization to ideal and useless channels must be identical. Duality also relates the tasks of channel coding and privacy amplification, implying that the finite blocklength performance of extractors and codes is precisely linked, and that optimal rate extractors can be transformed into capacity-achieving codes, and vice versa. Finally, duality also extends to the EXIT function of any channel and code. Here it implies that for any channel family, if the EXIT function for a fixed code has a sharp transition, then it must be such that the rate of the code equals the capacity at the transition. This may give a different route to proving a code family achieves capacity by establishing sharp EXIT function transitions.},

	Abstract = {Within the last two decades, Quantum Technologies (QT) have made tremendous progress, moving from Noble Prize award-winning experiments on quantum physics into a cross-disciplinary field of applied research. Technologies are being developed now that explicitly address individual quantum states and make use of the 'strange' quantum properties, such as superposition and entanglement. The field comprises four domains: Quantum Communication, Quantum Simulation, Quantum Computation, and Quantum Sensing and Metrology. One success factor for the rapid advancement of QT is a well-aligned global research community with a common understanding of the challenges and goals. In Europe, this community has profited from several coordination projects, which have orchestrated the creation of a 150-page QT Roadmap. This article presents an updated summary of this roadmap. Besides sections on the four domains of QT, we have included sections on Quantum Theory and Software, and on Quantum Control, as both are important areas of research that cut across all four domains. Each section, after a short introduction to the domain, gives an overview on its current status and main challenges and then describes the advances in science and technology foreseen for the next ten years and beyond.},

A fault-tolerant computational procedure ensures that errors do not multiply and spread. This review compares the leading proposals for promoting a quantum memory to a quantum processor. We compare magic state distillation, color code techniques and other alternative ideas, paying attention to relative resource demands. We discuss the several no-go results which hold for low-dimensional topological codes and outline the potential rewards of using high-dimensional quantum (LDPC) codes in modular architectures.},

@article{Winter2015,
	Abstract = {We present a bouquet of continuity bounds for quantum entropies, falling broadly into two classes: First, a tight analysis of the Alicki-Fannes continuity bounds for the conditional von Neumann entropy, reaching almost the best possible form that depends only on the system dimension and the trace distance of the states. Almost the same proof can be used to derive similar continuity bounds for the relative entropy distance from a convex set of states or positive operators. As applications we give new proofs, with tighter bounds, of the asymptotic continuity of the relative entropy of entanglement, {\$}E{\_}R{\$}, and its regularization {\$}E{\_}R{\^{}}\backslashinfty{\$}, as well as of the entanglement of formation, {\$}E{\_}F{\$}. Using a novel "quantum coupling" of density operators, which may be of independent interest, we extend the latter to an asymptotic continuity bound for the regularized entanglement of formation, aka entanglement cost, {\$}E{\_}C=E{\_}F{\^{}}\backslashinfty{\$}. Second, analogous continuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy and conditional entropy in infinite dimensional systems under an energy constraint, most importantly systems of multiple quantum harmonic oscillators. While without an energy bound the entropy is discontinuous, it is well-known to be continuous on states of bounded energy. However, a quantitative statement to that effect seems not to have been known. Here, under some regularity assumptions on the Hamiltonian, we find that, quite intuitively, the Gibbs entropy at the given energy roughly takes the role of the Hilbert space dimension in the finite-dimensional Fannes inequality.},

We also investigate whether reference states after the measurement can be ``recovered'' and further used for subsequent unambiguous identification tasks. We show that in spite of the fact that the recovered reference states are disturbed by measurements, they can be repeatedly used for unambiguous identifications. We analyze the influence of particular type of noise in the preparation of the unknown and the reference coherent states on the performance of our unambiguous-identification setup.},

	Abstract = {Known strategies for sending bits at the capacity rate over a general channel with classical input and quantum output (a cq channel) require the decoder to implement impractically complicated collective measurements. Here, we show that a fully collective strategy is not necessary in order to recover all of the information bits. In fact, when coding for a large number N uses of a cq channel W, N I(W{\_}acc) of the bits can be recovered by a non-collective strategy which amounts to coherent quantum processing of the results of product measurements, where I(W{\_}acc) is the accessible information of the channel W. In order to decode the other N (I(W) - I(W{\_}acc)) bits, where I(W) is the Holevo rate, our conclusion is that the receiver should employ collective measurements. We also present two other results: 1) collective Fuchs-Caves measurements (quantum likelihood ratio measurements) can be used at the receiver to achieve the Holevo rate and 2) we give an explicit form of the Helstrom measurements used in small-size polar codes. The main approach used to demonstrate these results is a quantum extension of Arikan's polar codes.},

Rigorous validation of these implementations require identifying, and surpassing, benchmarks set by the most effective strategies attainable without the use of quantum resources. Such benchmarks have been established for special families of input states, like coherent states and particular subclasses of squeezed states. Here we solve the longstanding problem of defining quantum benchmarks for general pure Gaussian single-mode states with arbitrary phase, dis- placement, and squeezing, randomly sampled according to a realistic prior distribution. As a special case, we show that the fidelity benchmark for teleporting squeezed states with totally random phase and squeez- ing degree is 1=2, equal to the corresponding one for coherent states. We discuss the use of entangled resources to beat the benchmarks in experiments.},

We define a new entanglement monotone, which we refer to as the max-relative entropy of entanglement, and which is an upper bound to the relative entropy of entanglement. We also generalize the min- and max-relative entropies to obtain smooth min- and max- relative entropies. These act as parent quantities for the smooth Renyi entropies, and allow us to define the analogues of the mutual information, in the Smooth Renyi Entropy framework. Further, the spectral divergence rates of the Information Spectrum approach are shown to be obtained from the smooth min- and max-relative entropies in the asymptotic limit.},

The effective Hamiltonian is arrived at by a single use of first-order perturbation theory avoiding the use of perturbation gadgets. The dynamics and spectral properties of the effective Hamiltonian can be fully determined as it corresponds to a particular realization of a mapping between a quantum circuit and a Hamiltonian called the space-time circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction. Because of the simple interactions required, and because no higher-order perturbation gadgets are employed, our construction is potentially realizable using superconducting or other solid-state qubits.},

PR-box correlations violate Bell/CHSH inequalities and are thus stronger -- more non-local -- than quantum mechanics; yet weak enough to respect special relativity in prohibiting faster-than-light communication. Understanding their power will yield insight into the non-locality of quantum mechanics. We exhibit two proof-of-concept channels: first, we show a channel between two sender-receiver pairs where the senders are not allowed to communicate, for which a shared super-quantum bit (a PR-box) allows perfect communication. This feat is not achievable with the best classical (senders share no resources) or quantum entanglement-assisted (senders share entanglement) strategies. Second, we demonstrate a class of channels for which a tunable parameter achieves a double separation of capacities; for some range of $\backslash$epsilon, the super-quantum assisted strategy does better than the entanglement-assisted strategy, which in turn does better than the classical one.},

Lett. 80, 2245 (1998)] has given an explicit formula for the entanglement of formation of two qubits in terms of what he calls the concurrence of the joint density operator. Wootters's concurrence is defined with the help of the superoperator that flips the spin of a qubit. We generalize the spin-flip superoperator to a ``universal inverter,'' which acts on quantum systems of arbitrary dimension, and we introduce the corresponding generalized concurrence for joint pure states of D1×D2 bipartite quantum systems. We call this generalized concurrence the I concurrence to emphasize its relation to the universal inverter. The universal inverter, which is a positive, but not completely positive superoperator, is closely related to the completely positive universal-NOT superoperator, the quantum analogue of a classical NOT gate. We present a physical realization of the universal-NOT superoperator.},

STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter ranodmized trial with 285 participants, (three exclusions) was performed with sealed envelopes stratified for parity and Bishop score. RESULTS: Outcomes of labor and delivery were clearly related to the cervical score at trial entry, especially in nulliparous women. Endocervical prostaglandin E2had a more marked effect on cervical ripeness than did vaginal prostaglandin E2, but this did not result in any differences in more substantive outcomes. Frequencies of delivery within 12 (50{\%}) and 24 hours (77.7{\%}), cesarean section (7.3{\%}), instrumental vaginal delivery (11.7{\%}), and poor infant outcomes were similar with both preparations. CONCLUSION: Because differences in effectiveness between endocervical and vaginal prostaglandin E2in triacetin gel are marginal, preferences of women and clinicians can determine the choice between them. {\textcopyright} 1995, All rights reserved.},

On the one hand, it prevents perfect cloning of quantum states and enables secure communication. On the other hand, it makes a grand challenge to reach the ultimate measurement precision. Although the minimum possible error rate (the Helstrom bound) has been known for almost five decades, there is no practical way to achieve it. Developing the realistic optimal measurement strategies to attain the Helstrom bound is of utmost importance for high-precision applications, long-distance free-space and optical fiber communication, gravitational wave detection, optical sensing in biology and medicine, to name a few. In this work, we show an optimal receiver for coherent states which admits a relatively simple technological implementation. The receiver is based on multichannel splitting of the signal, followed by feed-forward signal displacement and photon detection.},

One can quantify the worth of the resource by the relative entropy distance to the set of free states, and under certain conditions, this is a unique measure which quantifies the rate of state to state transitions. The framework includes entanglement, asymmetry and purity theory. It also includes thermodynamics, which is a hybrid resource theory combining purity theory and asymmetry. Another hybrid resource theory which merges purity theory and entanglement can be used to study quantumness of correlations and discord, and we present quantumness in this more general framework of resource theories.},

Moreover, we show that the bound between ambiguous and unambiguous discrimination does not extend to ensembles of more than two states. Specifically, the main technical contributions are described as follows: (1) We derive a new lower bound on the minimum-error probability for ambiguous discrimination among arbitrary {\$}m{\$} mixed quantum states with given prior probabilities, and we present a necessary and sufficient condition to show that this lower bound is attainable. (2) We compare this new lower bound with six other bounds in the literature in detail, and, in some cases, this bound is optimal. (3) It is known that if {\$}m=2{\$}, the optimal inconclusive probability of unambiguous discrimination {\$}Q{\_}{\{}U{\}}{\$} and the minimum-error probability of ambiguous discrimination {\$}Q{\_}{\{}E{\}}{\$} between arbitrary given {\$}m{\$} mixed quantum states have the relationship {\$}Q{\_}{\{}U{\}}\backslashgeq 2Q{\_}{\{}E{\}}{\$}. In this paper, we show that, however, if {\$}m{\textgreater}2{\$}, the relationship {\$}Q{\_}{\{}U{\}}\backslashgeq 2Q{\_}{\{}E{\}}{\$} may not hold again in general, and there may be no supremum of {\$}Q{\_}{\{}U{\}}/Q{\_}{\{}E{\}}{\$} for more than two states, which may also reflect an essential difference between discrimination for two-states and multi-states. (4) A number of examples are constructed.},

However, many such algorithms require the ability to produce states proportional to vectors stored in quantum memory. Even given access to quantum databases which store exponentially long vectors, the construction of which is considered a one-off overhead, it has been argued that the cost of preparing such amplitude-encoded states may offset any exponential quantum advantage. Here we argue that specifically in the context of machine learning applications it suffices to prepare a state close to the ideal state only in the {\$}\backslashinfty{\$}-norm, and that this can be achieved with only a constant number of memory queries.},

A central question is whether the theory is about our knowledge of reality, or a direct statement about reality itself. Regardless of their stance on this question, current interpretations of quantum theory regard the Born rule as fundamental and add an independent state-update (or "collapse") rule to describe how quantum states change upon measurement. In this paper we present an alternative perspective and derive a probability rule that subsumes both the Born rule and the collapse rule. We show that this more fundamental probability rule can provide a rigorous foundation for informational, or "knowledge-based", interpretations of quantum theory.},

With a noiseless linear amplifier it is possible to perform tasks such as improving the performance of quantum key distribution, purifying lossy channels, and distilling entanglement. Previous designs for noiseless linear amplifiers involving linear optics and photon counting are nonoptimal because they have a probability of success lower than the bound given by the theory of generalized quantum measurement. This paper develops a theoretical model using unitary interactions and projective measurements which reaches this limit. We calculate the fidelity and probability of success of this model for coherent states and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled states. Finally, we explore some examples of the complex interplay between the fidelity, probability, and the distilling and purifying power of the model. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

	Abstract = {Quantum information technologies, on the one side, and intelligent learning systems, on the other, are both emergent technologies that will likely have a transforming impact on our society in the future. The respective underlying fields of basic research -- quantum information (QI) versus machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) -- have their own specific questions and challenges, which have hitherto been investigated largely independently. However, in a growing body of recent work, researchers have been prob-ing the question to what extent these fields can indeed learn and benefit from each other. QML explores the interaction between quantum computing and machine learning, inves-tigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve the problems of the other. In recent time, we have witnessed significant breakthroughs in both directions of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital application in providing speed-ups for machine learning problems, critical in our " big data " world. Conversely, machine learning already permeates many cutting-edge technologies, and may become instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in data analysis, or classical machine learning optimization used in quantum experiments, quan-tum enhancements have also been (theoretically) demonstrated for interactive learning tasks, highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works exploring the use of artificial intelligence for the very design of quantum experiments, and for performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement -- exploring what ML/AI can do for quantum physics, and vice versa -- researchers have also broached the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of learning and AI concepts. This deals with questions of the very meaning of learning and intelligence in a world that is fully described by quantum mechanics. In this review, we describe the main ideas, recent developments, and progress in a broad spectrum of research investigating machine learning and artificial intelligence in the quantum domain.},

Such a constraint is nonlinear and nonsmooth, but convex, so semidefinite programs are convex optimization problems. Semidefinite programming unifies several standard problems (e.g., linear and quadratic programming) and finds many applications in engineering and combinatorial optimization. Although semidefinite programs are much more general than linear programs, they are not much harder to solve. Most interior-point methods for linear programming have been generalized to semidefinite programs. As in linear programming, these methods have polynomial worst-case complexity and perform very well in practice.

We focus on multimode bosonic Gaussian channels and classify those that are nonclassicality breaking by introducing a criterion that needs to be satisfied by the matrices representing these channels. The criterion can be interpreted as a nonclassicality benchmark for these channels since it quantifies the threshold noise at which there is a complete nonclassical to classical transition of the output states, i.e., it quantifies the robustness of the nonclassicality of the outputs of the channel against Gaussian noise.

In this work, we extend the entropic quantifiers of states to the ones of channels. In the one-shot and asymptotic scenarios, we propose relative entropies of channels under the task of hypothesis testing. Then, we define the entropy of channels based on relative entropies from the target channel to the completely depolarising channel. We also study properties of relative entropies of channels and the interplay with entanglement. Finally, based on relative entropies of channels, we propose general resource theories of channels and discuss the coherence of general channels and measurements, and the entanglement of channels.},

	Abstract = {We give a mathematical formulation for the Choi-Jamiolkowski (CJ) correspondence in the infinite-dimensional case in the form close to one used in quantum information theory. We show that there is no need to use a limiting procedure to define "unnormalized maximally entangled state" and the corresponding analog of the Choi matrix since they can be defined rigorously as, in general, nonclosable forms on an appropriate dense subspace. The properties of these forms are discussed in Sec. 2. An important question is: when the CJ form is given by a bounded operator. This is the case for entanglement-breaking channels: we prove this in Sec. 3 along with a version of a result of Wolf et al. characterizing CJ operators which correspond to such channels by giving precise definitions of a separable operator and a relevant integral. In Sec. 4 we obtain explicit expressions for CJ forms and operators defining a general Bosonic Gaussian channel. In Sec. 5 we give a decomposition of the Gaussian CJ form into product of the four principal types and a necessary and sufficient condition for existence of the bounded CJ operator.},

The interface between the p and n phases acts as a self-oscillating piston that modulates the absorption of heat from the photons so that it may perform a net positive work during a complete cycle of its motion, in accordance with the laws of thermodynamics. We draw a simple hydrodynamical analogy between this model and the "putt-putt" engine of toy boats, in which the interface between the water's liquid and gas phases serves as the piston.

The security of our scheme rests on an entropic uncertainty relation, in addition to the channel polarization effect. Our scheme achieves the symmetric private information rate by synthesizing "amplitude" and "phase" channels from an arbitrary quantum wiretap channel. We find that the secret-key consumption rate of the scheme vanishes for an arbitrary degradable quantum wiretap channel. Furthermore, we provide an additional sufficient condition for when the secret key rate vanishes, and we suspect that satisfying this condition implies that the scheme requires no secret key at all. Thus, this latter condition addresses an open question from the Mahdavifar-Vardy scheme for polar coding over a classical wiretap channel.},

	Abstract = {Degradable quantum channels are among the only channels whose quantum and private classical capacities are known. As such, determining the structure of these channels is a pressing open question in quantum information theory. We give a comprehensive review of what is currently known about the structure of degradable quantum channels, including a number of new results as well as alternate proofs of some known results. In the case of qubits, we provide a complete characterization of all degradable channels with two dimensional output, give a new proof that a qubit channel with two Kraus operators is either degradable or anti-degradable and present a complete description of anti-degradable unital qubit channels with a new proof. For higher output dimensions we explore the relationship between the output and environment dimensions ({\$}d{\_}B{\$} and {\$}d{\_}E{\$} respectively) of degradable channels. For several broad classes of channels we show that they can be modeled with a environment that is "small" in the sense {\$}d{\_}E \backslashleq d{\_}B{\$}. Perhaps surprisingly, we also present examples of degradable channels with ``large'' environments, in the sense that the minimal dimension {\$}d{\_}E {\textgreater} d{\_}B{\$}. Indeed, one can have {\$}d{\_}E {\textgreater} \backslashtfrac{\{}1{\}}{\{}4{\}} d{\_}B{\^{}}2{\$}. In the case of channels with diagonal Kraus operators, we describe the subclass which are complements of entanglement breaking channels. We also obtain a number of results for channels in the convex hull of conjugations with generalized Pauli matrices. However, a number of open questions remain about these channels and the more general case of random unitary channels.},

Automatic Repeat {\{}reQuest{\}} ({\{}ARQ){\}} techniques are used in unicast protocols, but they do not scale well to multicast protocols with large groups of receivers, since segment losses tend to become uncorrelated thus greatly reducing the effectiveness of retransmissions. In such cases, Forward Error Correction ({\{}FEC){\}} techniques can be used, consisting in the transmission of redundant packets (based on error correcting codes) to allow the receivers to recover from independent packet {\{}losses.Despite{\}} the widespread use of error correcting codes in many fields of information processing, and a general consensus on the usefulness of {\{}FEC{\}} techniques within some of the Internet protocols, very few actual implementations exist of the latter. This probably derives from the different types of applications, and from concerns related to the complexity of implementing such codes in software. To fill this gap, in this paper we provide a very basic description of erasure codes, describe an implementation of a simple but very flexible erasure code to be used in network protocols, and discuss its performance and possible applications. Our code is based on Vandermonde matrices computed over {\{}GF(pr){\}}, can be implemented very efficiently on common microprocessors, and is suited to a number of different applications, which are briefly discussed in the paper.

This scaling clearly limits our ability to do tomography to systems with no more than a few qubits and has been used to argue against the universal validity of quantum mechanics itself. However, from a computational learning theory perspective, it can be shown that, in a probabilistic setting, quantum states can be approximately learned using only a linear number of measurements. Here we experimentally demonstrate this linear scaling in optical systems with up to 6 qubits. Our results highlight the power of computational learning theory to investigate quantum information, provide the first experimental demonstration that quantum states can be "probably approximately learned" with access to a number of copies of the state that scales linearly with the number of qubits, and pave the way to probing quantum states at new, larger scales.},

Instinctively, one expects these benefits to vanish if causality is respected. Here we show that in harnessing entanglement, we can efficiently solve NP-complete problems and clone arbitrary quantum states - even when all time-travelling systems are completely isolated from the past. Thus, the many defining benefits of closed timelike curves can still be harnessed, even when causality is preserved. Our results unveil the subtle interplay between entanglement and general relativity, and significantly improve the potential of probing the radical effects that may exist at the interface between relativity and quantum theory.},

@article{Cook2007,
	Abstract = {Quantum mechanics hinders our ability to determine the state of a physical system in two ways: individual measurements provide only partial information about the observed system ( because of Heisenberg uncertainty), and measurements are themselves invasive - meaning that little or no refinement is achieved by further observation of an already measured system(1). Theoretical methods have been developed to maximize the information gained from a quantum measurement while also minimizing disturbance(2-4), but laboratory implementation of optimal measurement procedures is often difficult. The standard class of operations considered in quantum information theory(5) tends to rely on superposition-basis and entangled measurements(6), which require high-fidelity implementation to be effective in the laboratory(7). Here we demonstrate that real-time quantum feedback(8-10) can be used in place of a delicate quantum superposition, often called a 'Schrodinger cat state', to implement an optimal quantum measurement for discriminating between optical coherent states(11,12). Our procedure actively manipulates the target system during the measurement process, and uses quantum feedback to modify the statistics of an otherwise sub-optimal operator to emulate the optimal cat-state measurement. We verify a long-standing theoretical prediction(13) and demonstrate feedback-mediated quantum measurement(10,14) at its fundamental quantum limit over a non-trivial region of parameter space.},

@article{Alonso2016,
	Abstract = {A finite dimensional quantum system for which the quantum chaos conjecture applies has eigenstates, which show the same statistical properties than the column vectors of random orthogonal or unitary matrices. Here, we consider the different probabilities for obtaining a specific outcome in a projective measurement, provided the system is in one of its eigenstates. We then give analytic expressions for the joint probability density for these probabilities, with respect to the ensemble of random matrices. In the case of the unitary group, our results can be applied, also, to the phenomenon of universal conductance fluctuations, where the same mathematical quantities describe partial conductances in a two-terminal mesoscopic scattering problem with a finite number of modes in each terminal.},
