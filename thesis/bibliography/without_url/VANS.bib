abstract={The general problem of quantum compiling is to approximate any unitary transformation that describes the quantum computation as a sequence of elements selected from a finite base of universal quantum gates. The Solovay-Kitaev theorem guarantees the existence of such an approximating sequence. Though, the solutions to the quantum compiling problem suffer from a tradeoff between the length of the sequences, the precompilation time, and the execution time. Traditional approaches are time-consuming, unsuitable to be employed during computation. Here, we propose a deep reinforcement learning method as an alternative strategy, which requires a single precompilation procedure to learn a general strategy to approximate single-qubit unitaries. We show that this approach reduces the overall execution time, improving the tradeoff between the length of the sequence and execution time, potentially allowing real-time operations.},

abstract={Neural networks enjoy widespread success in both research and industry and, with the advent of quantum technology, it is a crucial challenge to design quantum neural networks for fully quantum learning tasks. Here we propose a truly quantum analogue of classical neurons, which form quantum feedforward neural networks capable of universal quantum computation. We describe the efficient training of these networks using the fidelity as a cost function, providing both classical and efficient quantum implementations. Our method allows for fast optimisation with reduced memory requirements: the number of qudits required scales with only the width, allowing deep-network optimisation. We benchmark our proposal for the quantum task of learning an unknown unitary and find remarkable generalisation behaviour and a striking robustness to noisy training data.},

@article{dpcontrolsto,
	abstract = {Control of the stochastic dynamics of a quantum system is indispensable in fields such as quantum information processing and metrology. However, there is no general ready-made approach to the design of efficient control strategies. Here, we propose a framework for the automated design of control schemes based on differentiable programming. We apply this approach to the state preparation and stabilization of a qubit subjected to homodyne detection. To this end, we formulate the control task as an optimization problem where the loss function quantifies the distance from the target state, and we employ neural networks (NNs) as controllers. The system's time evolution is governed by a stochastic differential equation (SDE). To implement efficient training, we backpropagate the gradient information from the loss function through the SDE solver using adjoint sensitivity methods. As a first example, we feed the quantum state to the controller and focus on different methods of obtaining gradients. As a second example, we directly feed the homodyne detection signal to the controller. The instantaneous value of the homodyne current contains only very limited information on the actual state of the system, masked by unavoidable photon-number fluctuations. Despite the resulting poor signal-to-noise ratio, we can train our controller to prepare and stabilize the qubit to a target state with a mean fidelity of around 85{\%}. We also compare the solutions found by the NN to a hand-crafted control strategy.},

A large dataset comprising stereo image pairs of 50 uniform-colored toys under 36 azimuths, 9 elevations, and 6 lighting conditions was collected (for a total of 194,400 individual images). The objects were 10 instances of 5 generic categories: four-legged animals, human figures, airplanes, trucks, and cars. Five instances of each category were used for training, and the other five for testing. Low-resolution grayscale images of the objects with various amounts of variability and surrounding clutter were used for training and testing. Nearest Neighbor methods, Support Vector Machines, and Convolutional Networks, operating on raw pixels or on PCA-derived features were tested. Test error rates for unseen object instances placed on uniform backgrounds were around 13% for SVM and 7% for Convolutional Nets. On a segmentation/recognition task with highly cluttered images, SVM proved impractical, while Convolutional nets yielded 16/7% error. A real-time version of the system was implemented that can detect and classify objects in natural scenes at around 10 frames per second.",

abstract={Neural network-based machine learning has recently proven successful for many complex applications ranging from image recognition to precision medicine. However, its direct application to problems in quantum physics is challenging due to the exponential complexity of many-body systems. Motivated by recent advances in realizing quantum information processors, we introduce and analyse a quantum circuit-based algorithm inspired by convolutional neural networks, a highly effective model in machine learning. Our quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) uses only O(log(N)) variational parameters for input sizes of N qubits, allowing for its efficient training and implementation on realistic, near-term quantum devices. To explicitly illustrate its capabilities, we show that QCNNs can accurately recognize quantum states associated with a one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological phase, with performance surpassing existing approaches. We further demonstrate that QCNNs can be used to devise a quantum error correction scheme optimized for a given, unknown error model that substantially outperforms known quantum codes of comparable complexity.

	abstract = {The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm combines the ability of quantum computers to efficiently compute expectation values with a classical optimization routine in order to approximate ground state energies of quantum systems. In this paper, we study the application of VQE to the simulation of molecular energies using the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz. We introduce new strategies to reduce the circuit depth for the implementation of UCC and improve the optimization of the wavefunction based on efficient classical approximations of the cluster amplitudes. Additionally, we propose an analytical method to compute the energy gradient that reduces the sampling cost for gradient estimation by several orders of magnitude compared to numerical gradients. We illustrate our methodology with numerical simulations for a system of four hydrogen atoms that exhibit strong correlation and show that the circuit depth of VQE using a UCC ansatz can be reduced without introducing significant loss of accuracy in the final wavefunctions and energies.},

abstract={The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2--7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times---our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8--14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

abstract={Applications such as simulating complicated quantum systems or solving large-scale linear algebra problems are very challenging for classical computers, owing to the extremely high computational cost. Quantum computers promise a solution, although fault-tolerant quantum computers will probably not be available in the near future. Current quantum devices have serious constraints, including limited numbers of qubits and noise processes that limit circuit depth. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which use a classical optimizer to train a parameterized quantum circuit, have emerged as a leading strategy to address these constraints. VQAs have now been proposed for essentially all applications that researchers have envisaged for quantum computers, and they appear to be the best hope for obtaining quantum advantage. Nevertheless, challenges remain, including the trainability, accuracy and efficiency of VQAs. Here we overview the field of VQAs, discuss strategies to overcome their challenges and highlight the exciting prospects for using them to obtain quantum advantage.},
