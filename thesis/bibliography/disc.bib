  	abstract = {It is a fundamental consequence of the superposition principle for quantum states               that there must exist nonorthogonal states, that is, states that, although different,               have a nonzero overlap. This finite overlap means that there is no way of determining               with certainty in which of two such states a given physical system has been prepared.               We review the various strategies that have been devised to discriminate optimally               between nonorthogonal states and some of the optical experiments that have been               performed to realize these.},

It is also proved that some other versions of the relative entropy give rise to the same asymptotics as Umegaki's one. As a byproduct, the inequality TrA logAB ≧TrA(logA+logB) is obtained for positive definite matricesA andB.},

@inbook{Stein2,
abstract = {The hypothesis testing problem for two quantum states is treated. We show a new inequality between the errors of the first kind and the second kind, which complements the result of Hiai and Petz to establish the quantum version of Stein's lemma. The inequality is also used to show a bound on the probability of errors of the first kind when the power exponent for the probability of errors of the second kind exceeds the quantum relative entropy, which yields the strong converse in quantum hypothesis testing. Finally, we discuss the relation between the bound and the power exponent derived by Han and Kobayashi in classical hypothesis testing. },
