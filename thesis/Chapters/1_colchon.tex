This chapter is aimed to explain both physics and algorithms studied in the thesis.

We begin with quantum physics; after recaping the basic ingredients of quantum information in Sec.~\ref{sec:1_introquantum}, we discuss about (discrete-variable) NISQ computing in Sec.~\ref{sec:1_nisq}. We then review continuous-variable quantum systems in Sec.~\ref{sec:1_cv}, with a particular focus on Gaussian states and operations. Introducing such a formalism allows us to discuss continuously-monitored systems in Sec.~\ref{sec:1_cmon}, and this consitutues the end of our tour through quantum systems.

Thus, in Sec.~\ref{sec:1_statinf} we turn to the classical world by discussing statistical inference problems, we discuss hypothesis-testing in Sec.~\ref{ssec:1_hypo_testing}, and consequently introduce the quantum state discrimination problem in Sec.~\ref{ssec:1_qdisc}. Moreover, we discuss parameter estimation in Sec.~\ref{ssec:1_stinf_estimation}.

Finally, we introduce the reinforcement learning framework in Sec.~\ref{sec:1_rl}, with a particular focus on model-free Q-learning agents.
