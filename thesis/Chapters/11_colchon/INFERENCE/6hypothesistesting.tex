It is time to put the attention on our (classical) daily lives. Arguably, the highlight of this century is \textit{data} (classical, at least for the first two decades), and motivating this Section by writing that \textit{we are surrounded by data} is, by now, a clich√©, though an useful one. In turn, we are constantly faced towards new information and we ussually need to take decisions based on it (either conciously or unconciously)\footnote{The number of such decisions is obviously a random variable, but neuro-science community estimate it to be around 35K per day~\cite{sahakian_bad_2013}}.

While many of our daily decisions turns to be hard to model, some others can be placed on the scientific stage (\textit{i.e.} an experiment, where we acquire data in a systematic way). In this situation, we can riguoursly study the model and increase the possibilities of taking correct decisions in the face of uncertainty. In this context, we will now turn study (binary) hypothesis discrimination in Sec~\ref{ssec:1_hypo_testing}, and parameter estimation in Sec.~\ref{ssec:1_stinf_estimation}.
