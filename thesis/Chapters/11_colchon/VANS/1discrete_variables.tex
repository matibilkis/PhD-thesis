In this Section we will focus on discrete-variable systems. Special attention will be payed to Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing, a concept standing for currently available technologies, where quantum circuits of about $50-100$ qubits are already being implemented and controlled despite the strong presence of noise~\cite{preskill2018quantum}.

While error-correcting codes cannot be built with such a low amount of qubits ---it is estimated that nearly a thousand \textit{physical qubits} are required in order to get a single \textit{logical qubit}~\cite{Fowler2012surface}--- special-purpose quantum devices can readily be built, exhibiting a genuinely quantum behaviour. Whether such techologies will be able to provide a game-changer quantum advantage in industry applications, or they are just a stepping stone towards fault-tolerant architectures is a matter of vivid debate between the community~\cite{supremacygoogle,nosupremacy,chemistrynono}. However, we remark that the sole feasibility of experimental preparation and control of quantum systems already constitute a game-changer paradigm in our scientific community. In turn, not only a plethora of new questions regarding scalability and overall implementation of such techologies arise~\cite{useful2discoverQC}, but also the demand for new theoretical tools, particularly to better analyze performance issues that we will later discuss~\cite{mcclean2018barren,cerezo2020cost,pesah2020absence,holmes2020barren,zhao2021analyzing,thanasilp2021subtleties,sharma2020trainability,patti2020entanglement,marrero2020entanglement,cerezo2020impact,arrasmith2020effect, npHardVQA}.

In the following we will concentrate on an specific topic that falls under the umbrella of NISQ computing, called Variational Quantum Algorithms.
