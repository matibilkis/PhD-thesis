% While Gaussian unitary transformations act as either displacing, rotating or squeezing gaussian distributions in phase space, we might explicit a more expedient characterization of Gaussian transformations.
A quantum channel is deemed Gaussian if it preserves the Gaussian character of the state. Such definition applies to unitary transformations, but also to CP-maps (which can suitably be obtained via a Stinespring dilation with an ancilla).% Moreover, such definition also holds for quantum measurements, in such case the outcome distribution is required to be Gaussian whenever the measured state is Gaussian as well.


A handful parametrization of Gaussian CP-maps can readily be obtained by studying the evolution of system's state after a Gaussian unitary interaction with a (Gaussian) auxiliary system. The result is an update rule for the first two moments, parametrized by matrices $X$ and $Y$ in $\mathbb{R}^{2n\times2n}$:
\begin{align}\label{eq:1_cv_gaussianCPmap}
\bm{\bar{r}} &\rightarrow X \bm{\bar{r}}\\
\cov &\rightarrow X \cov X^T + Y,
\end{align}
with $Y + \ii \Omega \geq \ii X\Omega X^T$ (such condition guarantees that Robertson-Schrödinger uncertainty relations in Eq.~\eqref{eq:uncer} are preserved). We note that such evolution is different than the resulting one when continuously monitoring the system, as studied in Sec.~\ref{sec:1_cmon}.

In particular an attenuator --- or \textit{lossy} channel --- is obtained by mixing a quantum state with the vacuum by a beam-splitter, and we denote it by $\mathcal{L}_\eta$, where $\eta$ is the transmissivity coefficient. For such a channel, and restricting to the single-mode case, one finds that $X=\eta \mathbb{I}_2$ and $Y = \sqrt{1-\eta^2}\mathbb{I}_2$, with $\eta\in[0,1]$. We note that if the input state is a coherent state, the covariance matrix remains unchanged (since $\cov = \mathbb{I}_2$), whereas the first moment gets attenuated as $\alpha \rightarrow \eta \alpha$. This channel turns to accurately model the behaviour of a laser beam transmitted through the atmosphere, though the transmissivity $\eta$ non-trivially depends on parameters such as height, temperature and
